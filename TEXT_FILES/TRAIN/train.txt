TrainSen	00010	 Well I can't even moderate my eating habits.
TrainSen	00010	 And I bash myself about it, but when hunger     calls, I respond.
TrainSen	00010	 In full!  So yeah.
TrainSen	00010	 Sometimes I fear for my safety when I'm walking around     at night.
TrainSen	00010	 Nothing ever bad has ever happened but I think I should still be careful.
TrainSen	00010	 But I     don't think so enough since I'm going to do it tonight anyway.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm going to watch the     Goonies at the Texas Union Theater.
TrainSen	00010	 Theatre.
TrainSen	00010	 Yeah.
TrainSen	00010	 Hey.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if I'm going to make     any good friends here at college.
TrainSen	00010	 It's bad hanging out with old ones all the time, and     believe me, sometimes I just don't want to.
TrainSen	00010	 Excuse me.
TrainSen	00010	 I just sneezed.
TrainSen	00010	 What if I do really     think in sentences?  I think I have a cold.
TrainSen	00010	 My nose is rubbed pretty raw (well, not really)     from all the tissues.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not thinking about anything.
TrainSen	00010	 Actually, what I would like is to     complete everything I need to get done soon.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know how possible that might be but     then that would leave me time to do leisurely activities, like reading and responding to     other people's e-mails.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm so bad at that.
TrainSen	00010	 And so I could have time to read the Bible and     pray.
TrainSen	00010	 Ah, I cannot control what I do, or at least I'm not trying hard enough.
TrainSen	00010	 It seems so     easy to be a good Christian when the pastor is talking about it but then laziness gets the     best of me.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh I can wait.
TrainSen	00010	 You know, I don't want to think I'm invincible.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to make a     difference and experience life fully.
TrainSen	00010	 The things I am most scared about now: public     speaking.
TrainSen	00010	 I just want to die when all eyes are on me- the bigger the audience, the more     humiliating.
TrainSen	00010	 You know, it's not like I can control how I feel, to an extent at least.
TrainSen	00010	 I am also     afraid of getting into a car accident because my close friends just did and it seems     unbearable, the time in the hospital spent recovering.
TrainSen	00010	 So many tubes.
TrainSen	00010	 I'd cry out.
TrainSen	00010	 And I'm     afraid of falling off my bike or getting into some other bike related accident.
TrainSen	00010	 It's not so     much the pain that bothers me, but the public scene it would cause.
TrainSen	00010	 How embarrassing.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00010	 Sometimes I don't care what other people think.
TrainSen	00010	 Sometimes I wonder what they     think of me.
TrainSen	00010	 When I'm shy, I tend to come across as being mean.
TrainSen	00010	 I haven't really opened     up to anyone before.
TrainSen	00010	 Why should I if I don't trust them or if I'm not sure that they care     about what I feel or think.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I'm good at observing people in their behaviors.
TrainSen	00010	 When     I'm talking to someone, I can tell if they lose interest in what I'm saying.
TrainSen	00010	 At that very     moment when they look away for a second.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't feel bad when that happens but it just     makes me lower the probability of me finding someone or some people who can connect     with me.
TrainSen	00010	 I know.
TrainSen	00010	 People need people.
TrainSen	00010	 And I need a tissue right now.
TrainSen	00010	 Is this going to be     read?  If it is, it's okay.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know if my thoughts are interesting, but it would be a fun     thing to grade.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like I'm spending less quality time when I'm reading out of my     textbooks.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to go back, but then I just get this feeling of urgency.
TrainSen	00010	 Even when I'm     surfing the net.
TrainSen	00010	 Imagine that.
TrainSen	00010	 What do I have to do anyway?  What's the difference     between an erection and an ejaculation?  I think I might know, but it doesn't matter so     much to me.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't like it how professors can say whatever they want to say, like curse     words and sex related and other inappropriate topics.
TrainSen	00010	 Just because they can talk about it     doesn't mean they should.
TrainSen	00010	 Sheesh.
TrainSen	00010	 I also don't like how repeated exposure to talk I don't     agree with and cuss words will desensitize me to it completely, probably by the end of the     semester.
TrainSen	00010	 Here I am in college and I don't know everyone but a lot of them are making me     less pure.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think they realize what they're doing to the rest of us.
TrainSen	00010	 What rest of us,     you ask?  I guess we are a minority then.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what I'm going to do for the final     project in my freshman seminar.
TrainSen	00010	 Either fencing, a Christian organization on campus, if I     ever find a good one!  or a concert.
TrainSen	00010	 Although a concert might be kinda difficult since I'm     not going to one until October 7th.
TrainSen	00010	 Yay for Beulah!  I'm so excited.
TrainSen	00010	 When I go to shows, I     feel like I belong.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know anyone there, but I like to observe them.
TrainSen	00010	 Most of them     have styles.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I had a style.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to be like them.
TrainSen	00010	 Or do I?  I want to be like me!  But,     I need to be more like me then.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe if I had a lot more money.
TrainSen	00010	 I do have a lot of     money.
TrainSen	00010	 What does being fashionable feel like?   Not as great as I think, of course.
TrainSen	00010	 It just     hurts to see people wearing things out of fashion when they think they are in fashion.
TrainSen	00010	 We     are the elite.
TrainSen	00010	 At least my mind can distinguish between the two.
TrainSen	00010	 But only street.
TrainSen	00010	 What do     I make of myself then?  It's easy not to care, but it's not so easy to do that completely.
TrainSen	00010	 Will     that make people like me more?  Is it easy to avoid everyone and keep to myself?  Is that     what we were meant to do?  The answer is no.
TrainSen	00010	 What if it's different for me?  Everyone dies     alone, right Donnie?  I think I need clothes to reach the next level.
TrainSen	00010	 Of making me satisfied.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh, if I had a different body.
TrainSen	00010	 No, no.
TrainSen	00010	 That's alright then.
TrainSen	00010	 People who know you don't care.
TrainSen	00010	 It's the people you are trying to impress who care!  Hah.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if I ever hurt anyone's     eyes.
TrainSen	00010	 It pains me to think so.
TrainSen	00010	 Before I left for college, at the goodbye dinner thrown for     me by my uncle, the message in my fortune cookie (or rather, one of them) was be     yourself and you will always be in fashion.
TrainSen	00010	 ""  I suppose that's valid.
TrainSen	00010	 Ooh I can continue     writing.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe for a bit longer.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what it would be like to be very fashionable.
TrainSen	00010	 I     mean, come on, I already struggle against feelings of superiority when it comes to music.
TrainSen	00010	 What good does it do?  There are always better, there are always worse.
TrainSen	00010	 But I won't say any     more about that.
TrainSen	00010	 You know, I can't give all of myself away    and to a stranger!         (ok, I finished editing my paper)_ do you think that this (spilling out thoughts on paper) is     healthy for all of us?  not that it's not, but compared to making no difference    I think so.
TrainSen	01000	Ah! 8secs! O no 16 sec! er.
TrainSen	01000	 er.
TrainSen	01000	 what am I supposed to type.
TrainSen	01000	 this is kinda stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 ah! phone! must not answer.
TrainSen	01000	 must not answer! hi Shawn! er.
TrainSen	01000	 talking to Shawn.
TrainSen	01000	 typing with one hand.
TrainSen	01000	 not thinking straight.
TrainSen	01000	 can't multi-task.
TrainSen	01000	 Ah! 2min 17 sec! hang up Shawn! hang up! eeek.
TrainSen	01000	 panicking! Talking about tomorrow's chem Exam.
TrainSen	01000	 Man, didn't even know until just a few minutes ago when Shawn called to remind me.
TrainSen	01000	 Hm.
TrainSen	01000	 I should start studying right after I finish this.
TrainSen	01000	 I got to get more organized and responsible.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder what other peoples thoughts are like, I watched What Women Want not too long ago, that is a very interesting movie.
TrainSen	01000	 it says a lot about how women think.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if any of it is actually true.
TrainSen	01000	 wouldn't it be nice to know what women are thinking.
TrainSen	01000	 I would like that power, I can never really tell what they are thinking.
TrainSen	01000	 my room mate is watching an anime with cute girl voices and drama.
TrainSen	01000	 I think it's called Kare Kano or something like that.
TrainSen	01000	 reminds me of Fruits basket.
TrainSen	01000	 o well, hm.
TrainSen	01000	 there never seems to be adiquet lighting around my work area.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe I should get another light, my room mate is laughing.
TrainSen	01000	 the anime sounds funny, making all those funny anime noises.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss something.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know what.
TrainSen	01000	 I should call An-Vi earlier today, I think she was kind of disappointed that I didn't call her the other day.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how college is like for her in UTSA, she says it is nice and all, but I bet there are a lot of good looking guys there.
TrainSen	01000	 heh, what am I talking.
TrainSen	01000	 thinking about.
TrainSen	01000	 shouldn't worry.
TrainSen	01000	 hm.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder.
TrainSen	01000	 don't know what I'm wondering, Juliet's thoughts were much better I think, mine are just not really relevant.
TrainSen	01000	 ice cream.
TrainSen	01000	 why? I don't know.
TrainSen	01000	 being influenced by others thoughts :p o well.
TrainSen	01000	 need more water, can't drink water from first few weeks of school.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss hugging her.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel lonely.
TrainSen	01000	 don't know why, there are a lot of pretty girls in UT Austin, a lot of asians.
TrainSen	01000	 wonder why everyone likes to party so much.
TrainSen	01000	 mom always says that there will be someone for me, there are tons of pretty girls in UT.
TrainSen	01000	 guess she was right, but don't know if any of them will like me.
TrainSen	01000	 :sigh: I would like a better hair style, mine seems too plane, I would like to spike it like Goku but not as short as most guys nowadays.
TrainSen	01000	 14 min.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how much I've written, I should learn to type faster.
TrainSen	01000	 ice cream.
TrainSen	01000	 food.
TrainSen	01000	 hm.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been eating less lately.
TrainSen	01000	 pretty much only eating lunch.
TrainSen	01000	 a late lunch at that, The hills are a live with the sound of music!"" heh, don't know why I just thought of that, 15 min.
TrainSen	01000	 hm.
TrainSen	01000	 :looking at finish button: I wonder if I'll be able to print this out.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I'm not thinking deep enough, I wonder why.
TrainSen	01000	 should I go back this week or no? I want to because my parents probably miss me, and I want to tell them to be less stressed so their immune system won't become worse.
TrainSen	01000	 there is a potluck party this weekend back home apparently.
TrainSen	01000	 my roommate is going back, I'm not really thinking any of this I think.
TrainSen	01000	 it's more like a cover of what my mind is really chaotically thinking about.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know, I can't explain it.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't sleep well.
TrainSen	01000	 never could.
TrainSen	01000	 wish I could.
TrainSen	01000	 then I could stay awake in class.
TrainSen	01000	 :blank:.
TrainSen	01000	 well, Merry x'mass for you is on my songs list.
TrainSen	01000	 it's sung by Aya Matsuura.
TrainSen	01000	 wouldn't it be nice to be friends with her, I wonder if I can ever become really important, eh, I think it's more important to know as much as possible and help more people, like superman or something.
TrainSen	01000	 well, hm.
TrainSen	01000	 about 55 sec left.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I should type something more meaningful, I've pressed backspace a lot.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how my sister is.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go to a party.
TrainSen	01000	 and meet more people.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how Daniel is, he was mad at me, don't know for sure now.
TrainSen	01000	 Juliet is cool, she likes some things that I didn't know anyone else would like, interesting how life works out.
TrainSen	01000	 didn't know my friend in high school's hobbies would make me interested in something that someone else would be interested in.
TrainSen	01000	 funny how life is.
TrainSen	01000	 I've coincidently met people I've not really known but just know on the streets of the campus lately.
TrainSen	01000	 like Grace and LiLa and some other friends.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I'm getting better at talking.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to get smarter.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel small for some reason.
TrainSen	01000	 dreams are for the lazy.
TrainSen	01000	 goals are for the ambitious.
TrainSen	01000	 I like to dream.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm ambitious.
TrainSen	01000	 is that bad or good? I have no idea.
TrainSen	00100	This is the psychology writing assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 I hear people talking and I do not like what they are saying I have so much to do today, and I've already done so much.
TrainSen	00100	 what am I going to do when I get home.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I'm hungry but I don't feel faint like usual.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to talk to matt about things but then again he just gets upset.
TrainSen	00100	 more talking that I don't want to hear.
TrainSen	00100	 there is training going on and he seems to be annoyed with the guy.
TrainSen	00100	 like I'm annoyed.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if carol has written me back.
TrainSen	00100	 this is actually a weird assignment, but very easy, my fingers are getting tired because I type quite fast.
TrainSen	00100	 I know I have some mistakes but I doubt the professor cares.
TrainSen	00100	 I met some guy in class the other day.
TrainSen	00100	 his name is, well I shouldn't tell you the name.
TrainSen	00100	 he draws stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 that reminds me he gave me a website to go visit and I don't have it with me.
TrainSen	00100	 that's a bummer, huih? I wonder what bill is doing.
TrainSen	00100	 I shouldn't be thinking about him, I should be thinking about mat.
TrainSen	00100	 matt matt matt.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that guy that just walked in.
TrainSen	00100	 he was in my mis class and he was annoying.
TrainSen	00100	 why do I keep saying that word.
TrainSen	00100	 annoying annoying annoying in my head.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm really not like that and it's only been 3 minutes writing.
TrainSen	00100	 what if someone can't type very well and they do this assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 their brain processes stuff faster than what they are typing.
TrainSen	00100	 I bet they would only get a few lines out before time was up.
TrainSen	00100	 what is the point of this experiment.
TrainSen	00100	 I would like to know professor! anyhow I'm still hungry I just want to vedge out because I've been at school all day long and it's already 7:10 in the evening.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to go home but I'd rather not ride the bus.
TrainSen	00100	 you know this morning the bus was so crowded.
TrainSen	00100	 stop talking man! I want you to shut up.
TrainSen	00100	 this guy is always in the computer lab.
TrainSen	00100	 he mentioned that he went to college but never managed to graduate and now he works here.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what I think about that.
TrainSen	00100	 At first I felt sorry for him.
TrainSen	00100	 Old Navy.
TrainSen	00100	 must go there to return some clothes that doesn't fit me, not because they're too small, but because I bought them one size too big.
TrainSen	00100	 That's not like me I bought the clothes in San Francisco.
TrainSen	00100	 I know and now I'm returning them here.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it was definitely an impulse buy.
TrainSen	00100	 I bought a shirt that had #24 on there.
TrainSen	00100	 oh god, it's only been 6 minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 this is way too long.
TrainSen	00100	 this is going to give me what is it calle? carpal tunnel syndrome.
TrainSen	00100	 thanks a lot prof! I'm just hungry don't mind me.
TrainSen	00100	 I actually talk to myself that's great to know.
TrainSen	00100	 matt told me he thought I talked to myself, but I only do it when n someone is in the room because I know that person is listening.
TrainSen	00100	 my sister on the other hand, talks to herself.
TrainSen	00100	 in the shower, while getting ready, while doing something.
TrainSen	00100	 she doesn't realize it, I don't think.
TrainSen	00100	 and now she is a professor at a community college in san antonio, where my parents live.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm actually kind of scared of what I might write here today because now there is 8 minutes left.
TrainSen	00100	 can't wait for this to be over over over.
TrainSen	00100	 yesterday I felt horrible.
TrainSen	00100	 it was just a bad day all together and I recently took that pretest thing that 301 requires.
TrainSen	00100	 it made me think of all this stuff I don't want to think about.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if I'm really crazy and the survey is going to tell me that.
TrainSen	00100	 like they would send me an e-mail saying  thank you for participating, and you're crazy"" ""go see a psychiatrist"" yeah that's what they would do.
TrainSen	00100	 well they wouldn't because everything is so damn professional now a days.
TrainSen	00100	 you have to sign consent forms and give up your unborn child and all that stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if I'm being funny.
TrainSen	00100	 prof, if you're reading this, you must have a lot of time on your hands.
TrainSen	00100	 that guy that asked me if he could borrow my pen.
TrainSen	00100	 he had some thing on his head.
TrainSen	00100	 it looked like pantyhose tied at the back.
TrainSen	00100	 what is that? what's that for? I don't even think that prevents you from getting hot or cold.
TrainSen	00100	 it's one of those fashion things I obviously I don't understand.
TrainSen	00100	 yeah things are too strict now.
TrainSen	00100	 you can't do things you used to and people feel ""safer"" but it's just a lot of fear building up that's going to explode one of these days.
TrainSen	00100	 how sad is that? I hope I'm in another country when it all blows up.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't even think people realize it because not everyone is thinking that way.
TrainSen	00100	 they just live their lives and not care.
TrainSen	00100	 like people who don't vote.
TrainSen	00100	 I just think that kind of indifference is why the country is going to s#$@#$ yeah I'm not going to cuss here.
TrainSen	00100	 I bet you're having a good time with this, professor pennebaker.
TrainSen	00100	 ok now there is only 7 minutes left and counting.
TrainSen	00100	 whoohoo! I can't wait to go home.
TrainSen	00100	 I've done all this crap online today because my internet does not work at home on my computer.
TrainSen	00100	 it works on my roommate's but not mind.
TrainSen	00100	 that's just a bunch of crap.
TrainSen	00100	 that reminds me, I should get a netzero customer service number while I have the internet available.
TrainSen	00100	 I bet it's dark outside.
TrainSen	00100	 what am I having for dinner? sometimes I just have popcorn for dinner.
TrainSen	00100	 isn't that sad? I just don't have that much money to be spending here and there.
TrainSen	00100	 oooh.
TrainSen	00100	 but yesterday I did buy chik fil a for lunch.
TrainSen	00100	 that might have been a bad move because I was feeling nauseated after that.
TrainSen	00100	 it's not good when you have to sit through an hour and 15 minute class.
TrainSen	00100	 yes that's yours, professor! I like your class though.
TrainSen	00100	 it's so different from what I've taken here at UT and I've taken A LOT, believe me! I just think this whole pre=health thing that I am doing is just me trying to prove something to myself (first and foremost) and to others.
TrainSen	00100	 I just want to know that I can do it.
TrainSen	00100	 I think the profession I want to go into, optometry, is a good profession.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I spend a lot of time slacking off.
TrainSen	00100	 sometimes I'm really down on myself and I'm very hard on myself.
TrainSen	00100	 I  wish I were not like that but what are you going to do? at least I'm not like I was last fall.
TrainSen	00100	 I was such a mess.
TrainSen	00100	 my survey will probably prove that.
TrainSen	00100	 it was a very dark time in my life.
TrainSen	00100	 yesterday part of that came back and that is why yesterday was not such a good day.
TrainSen	00100	 I cried like I used to cry last year and it wasn't like me.
TrainSen	00100	 I thought a lot of that aspect of healing was over, but I guess every once and awhile it comes back.
TrainSen	00100	 I just have this feeling that she is not gone and she is going to somehow come back into my life.
TrainSen	00100	 is this supposed to make me feel better? well gosh darnet it's working.
TrainSen	00100	 I usually don't say things like ""gosh darnet"" but today must be your lucky day, professor pennebaker.
TrainSen	00100	 I like that last name.
TrainSen	00100	 I bet you have a lot of fun with that.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm curious to hear what music is played tomorrow before class starts.
TrainSen	00100	 uh oh only one minute left.
TrainSen	00100	 better make the rest of this good.
TrainSen	00100	 mmmm.
TrainSen	00100	 chicken tenders.
TrainSen	00100	 that's what I wanted last night but was too lazy to drive and get it.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not that much a lazy person.
TrainSen	00100	 I worked out on sunday morning and am still sore from it.
TrainSen	00100	 that means I'm supposed to work out today.
TrainSen	00100	 only 10 seconds left I hope you've learned a lot from me prof.
TrainSen	00010	I'm hungry, but I don't have any of the food I normally eat.
TrainSen	00010	 If I had a car, I'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more Myoplex (protein shakes) and some cereal and some milk, but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such, so they wouldn't let me bring my car this semester.
TrainSen	00010	 If I had gone to school out of state, like both my brother and sister did before me, I wouldn't be getting a car for the entire first year, but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was, and I have some scholarships on top of that, my parents are considering letting me bring my car to Austin at semester.
TrainSen	00010	 I really don't know where there's room to park a Ford Expedition in this town, but I'll find some place.
TrainSen	00010	 My car would have been nice to have last last Sunday morning, because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse, which is too far to walk to, and I ended up not being able to go because I couldn't find a ride.
TrainSen	00010	 I was pretty upset, but My R.
TrainSen	00010	 A.
TrainSen	00010	 Danny, the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team, told me to go to practice this morning anyway, and the coaches wouldn't mind.
TrainSen	00010	 He was right.
TrainSen	00010	 I just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that I wasn't able to attend, went through the workout, and they told me to come back on Wednesday.
TrainSen	00010	 It was a lot tougher than I would have thought, in some respects, but a lot less strenuous in others, when I look back at it.
TrainSen	00010	 The one mile jog wasn't hard at all, and neither were the pull-ups, but eventually the sit-ups wore me out, and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets.
TrainSen	00010	 I think that's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before, which was a bad move on my part, but it's hard to say.
TrainSen	00010	 I've never done jump-squats before, so I might have felt sick afterwards without being sore.
TrainSen	00010	 We didn't get to go out on the water, which was somewhat disappointing, but the group of guys I was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday, while the other groups run body circuits, since that's all our group was able to do.
TrainSen	00010	 We did actually take a boat down to the dock, and set it in the water, but I wasn't able to get in, and the boat never left the dock, so it wasn't as much fun as it could have been.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session.
TrainSen	00010	 We get to use the rowing machines for the first time, and I've never used one before.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze, or if I'm really going to throw up this time.
TrainSen	00010	 I work out 6 days a week, and I run, and most of my workouts are repetition, not heavy lifting, so I could definitely be in worse shape for rowing, but I'm still not sure how far away I am from the kind of endurance I need for the urgs"" (rowing machines.
TrainSen	00010	 )  I would actually be stronger, but have less endurance if my shoulder hadn't been giving me problems all through high school.
TrainSen	00010	 I pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the New York airport after a two week cruise through Southern Europe.
TrainSen	00010	 We went to the doctor, they told me to lay off it, and I did, but apparently it wasn't long enough.
TrainSen	00010	 I was too anxious to get back in the gym, and I never let it heal completely, so about six months later I hurt it again.
TrainSen	00010	 Six months after that, when it happened the third time, my parents took me to a doctor, and eventually to physical therapy.
TrainSen	00010	 The therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals, triceps, biceps, and deltoids.
TrainSen	00010	 Apparently I hadn't trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body, which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements, where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder.
TrainSen	00010	 The doctor was amazed that both shoulders hadn't been more severely damaged, but I was told that I wasn't beyond repair.
TrainSen	00010	 A full month of therapy, very specific exercises, cross-friction massages, and ice massages helped a lot, but my shoulder is still pretty fragile.
TrainSen	00010	 If I push myself too hard on the bench press, or if I don't put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout, it's sore for the next few days.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back, especially the scapular region, so I can push myself harder at the gym when I'm training the rest of my upper body.
TrainSen	00010	 The pull-ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that I can feel had been neglected, because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull-ups.
TrainSen	00010	 Apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work, so I'm happy with the training so far.
TrainSen	00010	 I was actually worried for a while that I wouldn't be able to train the rest of my body if I got serious rowing, but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps, so the rest of your body will need developing too, like your chest and triceps.
TrainSen	00010	 This means I can still go to the gym, and I actually have more reason now than ever, because I have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that I will undoubtedly be developing.
TrainSen	00010	 Running and jump-squats in training won't come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout I want, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day.
TrainSen	00010	 I suppose that after a few weeks of real practice, assuming I make the team, I'll be able to decide when to work my legs, and how hard.
TrainSen	00010	 Some of the guys there seemed to have been working out, or playing football in high school, because they were pretty used to running body-circuits, and jogging, and weren't too beat at the end of the day.
TrainSen	00010	 Some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness.
TrainSen	00010	 A few people vomited, one guy passed out, and I heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not sure exactly what was going on there, but I'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't wait for it to get cold outside, so I can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse.
TrainSen	00010	 It was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 80 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator.
TrainSen	00010	 Once it gets colder, I'm sure I'll have to buy a sweatshirt, and some warmer gym shorts, but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse.
TrainSen	00010	 It'll be a lot colder if I fall in the water too, but I'm hoping that won't happen too often.
TrainSen	10000	What an odd assignment, write about anything for 20 minutes straight.
TrainSen	10000	 I really like UT but it is so huge, sometimes I wished I had stayed in College Station.
TrainSen	10000	 My boyfriend and friends are still in College Station, I was so close to Houston and that is were my family resides.
TrainSen	10000	 Its only a hour and a half drive but from Austin its an extra 30 minutes and you can definitely feel the difference when driving.
TrainSen	10000	 My brother is nearby in San Marcos and that is only spitting distance from here.
TrainSen	10000	 While living at home this past summer I didn't like it that much, now I really miss those crazy people I call my family.
TrainSen	10000	 There was always a fair share of fighting but in some weird way that is how we express our love.
TrainSen	10000	 I really need to start working out again because living in Austin is making me chubby.
TrainSen	10000	 You would think that walking around campus would be enough exercise but you are sadly mistaking.
TrainSen	10000	 I have so much math homework which by the way is due tomorrow, I can't wait to see my boyfriend who is coming in tomorrow.
TrainSen	10000	 Its our 6 month anniversary and most of the relationship has been a long distance one.
TrainSen	10000	 I have known him for about 2 years now and its definitely better to be friends first.
TrainSen	10000	 My family loves him except for my crazy step dad, he is pretty weird guy anyways.
TrainSen	10000	 He is always grumpy about something especially when it comes to money.
TrainSen	10000	 Money really is the root of all evil, but you can't live comfortably without it.
TrainSen	10000	 Everything is so expensive now and days, the cost of gas is absolutely outrages.
TrainSen	10000	 What is crazy is that me and my boyfriends anniversary is on such a tragic day in American history.
TrainSen	10000	 So many innocent people lot their live for no apparent good reason, and it all happened instantly.
TrainSen	10000	 Its very scary to think that today could be your last on this earth.
TrainSen	10000	 Its hard to imagine what I would do if somebody close to me perished in such a horrific way.
TrainSen	10000	 Its hard to think about without getting emotional.
TrainSen	10000	 I would hate to grow old and have to watch my loved ones pass first, I would rather go before everyone even thought that sounds greedy.
TrainSen	10000	 Its pouring down rain right now, and I hate living alone when the weather is nasty outside.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm tired of being broke it seems to suck my spirit right out of me sometimes, I definitely feel I'm paying my dues though and hopefully I can do something positive with this college education.
TrainSen	10000	My name is Ashley Mitchell and I am getting ready to write everything that crosses my mind within the next 20 minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I'm thing about all the reading I have to do for my classes and what am I supposed to do with myself since I don't have a Psychology book.
TrainSen	10000	 The book won't be coming in until Monday.
TrainSen	10000	 I believe in God so I now that he will make a way for me to get my hands on a Psychology Book.
TrainSen	10000	 What tv show comes on tonight and how long is this scholarship dinner going to be.
TrainSen	10000	 Why does the Rugrats tv show come on in the middle of the day.
TrainSen	10000	 What is my sister up to today? When is their next Battle of The Bands? My back hurts from typing so awkwardly.
TrainSen	10000	 It's only been 4 minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 It seems like I've typed everything I can think about.
TrainSen	10000	 The lunch was pretty good I had I just wonder was it too fattening.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to call the football trainer and see if I can get in touch with him.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to start making connections now as a freshman if I want to accomplish my goals.
TrainSen	10000	 HHMMMMmMMMm.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't think the new Romeo show will be any good.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to go and practice the piano since I haven't practiced since I left home.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to find an organization that's perfect for me and I think the Texas Gospel is perfect.
TrainSen	10000	 HMMMMMMM.
TrainSen	10000	 I've never met the professor yet and I really have no idea what this class is going to be about.
TrainSen	10000	 It seems like it could be interesting though.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm glad I made the decision to come to UT.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel like I've made a major change with myself.
TrainSen	10000	 Spiritually, socially, and physically.
TrainSen	10000	 I've grown up with black people my entire life.
TrainSen	10000	 At first I thought that it was going to be a total culture shock, but I shocked myself when I found out it's pretty cool to meet people other than your own race.
TrainSen	10000	 I enjoy being with my people and all, but sometimes in life you have to step out and do something for yourself.
TrainSen	10000	 If I had a went to a school with most of the people I already knew I probably wouldn't make any new friends which isn't good.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to get a job when I get back to Houston.
TrainSen	10000	 What time is it.
TrainSen	10000	 What time does my Psychology class begin.
TrainSen	10000	 It begins at 3:30 so I still have plenty of time.
TrainSen	10000	 Let me put my folder into my bag so that I won't leave it here.
TrainSen	10000	 Boy I sure don't feel like walking to class in this heat.
TrainSen	10000	 Burdine hall is too far away.
TrainSen	10000	 I know that it's good exercise and all, but I just don't feel like walking.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't see how people can stand to live in Austin.
TrainSen	10000	 There is nothing here to do, but go to school.
TrainSen	10000	 At least I haven't seen anything here that would make me want to live here.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to turn the tv volume down a little so that I can really think.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm going to work out today.
TrainSen	10000	 It feels good to work out.
TrainSen	10000	 My roommate is probably wondering what am I still doing typing on the computer because I have been on the computer for almost and hour and I've been typing for almost 20 minutes straight with slight hesitation.
TrainSen	10000	 So what is Prof Pennebaker going to do with all these thoughts when he reads them.
TrainSen	10000	 My head is itching and it is too cold up in this building.
TrainSen	00010	My head hurts so bad right now, why.
TrainSen	00010	 I need more tea, I'm thirsty.
TrainSen	00010	 what do I have to do tomorrow.
TrainSen	00010	 bio.
TrainSen	00010	 lab, lots of reading.
TrainSen	00010	 that sucks, I wonder how many pages I actually have to read, like 4 chapters.
TrainSen	00010	 ew.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to turn in this form to the health office, actually I'm not sure where I need to turn it into, I should call Alexis and find out.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I had frozen yogurt right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I need a job.
TrainSen	00010	 where are my roommates are.
TrainSen	00010	 my head hurts so bad right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to get one of those egg crate things for my bed, I think that'll help my back, I'm so tired, I need to take a nap.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to do homework.
TrainSen	00010	 I should call my mom later and tell her about the stress causes immune suppression thing, what's my brother is doing.
TrainSen	00010	 I should call my dad too, I haven't talked to him like four weeks.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to send him the letter I wrote.
TrainSen	00010	 wow, my head really hurts.
TrainSen	00010	 I should call Lora and see if she is going to be in College Station this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder why her and her boyfriend broke up, he is a jerk, oh well.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to call Ashley and tell her to buy me a gift for Jena's birthday this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish it was my birthday, I need a vacation already.
TrainSen	00010	 how many tests I have next week.
TrainSen	00010	 Adam's coming next week, what time does his flight come in, I should call him tonight and find out.
TrainSen	00010	 what time does he get off work, I need to find a nice place for us to eat, what's on sixth street, I should call Ashely she had know.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to clean my room before friday.
TrainSen	00010	 yesterday was grandparents day I think, I need to call my grandma.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to go to New York for the winter break.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm so tired right now.
TrainSen	00010	 Sept.
TrainSen	00010	 11 is this week, wow, that is like two years, goodness.
TrainSen	00010	 wow.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to go to the grocery store.
TrainSen	00010	 oh yay, Amy's home.
TrainSen	00010	 this should be fun, except not at all, I wonder if she is driving to class tomorrow, I should get a ride, I hate riding the bus.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate standing up on the bus.
TrainSen	00010	 I think it should be a rule that if you're a boy you have to stand up for girls on the bus.
TrainSen	00010	 my first class is at 10 in the morning.
TrainSen	00010	 I have so much to read.
TrainSen	00010	 did I take my medicine this morning.
TrainSen	00010	 I think.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't believe how much I forget lately, I need to get that checked out.
TrainSen	00010	 Sarah's team is playing us in a volleyball tournament this weekend, I should call her and see what time so I can go watch, Staci is coming in this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 oh, that's going to be so much fun.
TrainSen	00010	 we should go downtown.
TrainSen	00010	 I need money.
TrainSen	00010	 I need a job, I wonder if I can get a job here at the apartment complex, I bet that'd lower my rent.
TrainSen	00010	 all of a sudden I stopped capitalizing my I's .
TrainSen	00010	 I think it makes me type faster.
TrainSen	00010	 that's neat, I love my smell-good candle, my head hurts, how long does advil take to work, I need to go check my mail .
TrainSen	00010	 when's our electric bill due? I'm hungry, what did I eat today.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to buy more milk and sweet n low.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not going to the grocery store till sunday, oh, I have to get my film developed before monday, I should take it to one hour photo, at the grocery store.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what Alexis is doing, I should go chill with her instead of reading for bio.
TrainSen	00010	 discussion.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to clean my room and do laundry before this weekend, oh my stomach hurts too.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if I took my ulcer medicine this morning, I need to get my prescription filled.
TrainSen	00010	 I have to go register to vote in Austin this week, or next week maybe.
TrainSen	00010	 oh my gosh my head is killing me this sucks.
TrainSen	00010	 oh my 20 minutes are up.
TrainSen	00001	Trying to talk to my friends on the computer but I have to do this writing assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 At least its easy, right? Oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 I was bored anyways and this should keep me occupied.
TrainSen	00001	 what am I going to do tonight.
TrainSen	00001	 don't really want to go to southwest with kyle again.
TrainSen	00001	 it usually turns out to be rather boring anyways.
TrainSen	00001	 I really like this new piebald cd.
TrainSen	00001	 its happy.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate the keyboard on my laptop though.
TrainSen	00001	 not very anatomically correct.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that is the way of putting it at least.
TrainSen	00001	 what difference does it really make though.
TrainSen	00001	 time for new music though.
TrainSen	00001	 piebald is only good for so long.
TrainSen	00001	 I have rather odd taste in music, strange how much it can vary really.
TrainSen	00001	 this time is the last time, so be here now.
TrainSen	00001	 no reason to worry, everything will be fine.
TrainSen	00001	 soundtrack for our movie is an excellent song.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if I say that just because this girl likes it? odd how people can have influence on decisions.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to read more.
TrainSen	00001	 especially for school.
TrainSen	00001	 I just can't focus and retain any of it.
TrainSen	00001	 and then it makes me not want to read for myself, which sucks.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm tired, I should go to sleep.
TrainSen	00001	 but I know I won't and I probably won't get much sleep tonight which sucks as well.
TrainSen	00001	 so much to do, so little time.
TrainSen	00001	 its cold in my room, I should put on a sweatshirt, probably won't though.
TrainSen	00001	 weakness of will, is that an example of it? not necessarily I suppose because there is no right or wrong in that example.
TrainSen	00001	 but is there such thing as right or wrong, at least as an ultimate, underlying right or wrong.
TrainSen	00001	 there has to be a determination of right and wrong in every person, with his or her own definition of it though, right? or in some instances could you just act on instinct and impulse and not have any understanding of what is the right course of action and what the wrong one is.
TrainSen	00100	Basically right now I am feeling a little bit stressed out.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to go to this Fiesta tonight for my sorority and I think it will be really fun, but we have to dress up.
TrainSen	00100	 I have no idea yet what I am going to wear.
TrainSen	00100	 On top of all of that I have class pretty much all day today.
TrainSen	00100	 My Freshmen Seminar is really interesting, but we stayed last week for the entire 3 hours and that is just kind of a long time to be hearing about libraries.
TrainSen	00100	 For some reason I am also feeling kind of overwhelmed by school.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know if I am behind or if I will be prepared for the tests or what.
TrainSen	00100	 I always thought that I would have so much more time in college because I wouldn't be at school for 9 hours a day, but for some reason I never seem to have enough time.
TrainSen	00100	 And wow, right now I am really tired.
TrainSen	00100	 I wanted to try to get to sleep kind of early last night so I could wake up early today and get some things done, but of course that didn't happen.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm also pretty hungry so I need to decide on something to have for lunch.
TrainSen	00100	 We really need to go to the grocery store because we don't really have any good food.
TrainSen	00100	 I could go eat in the cafeteria, but for some reason I don't just love that food.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean it's not really bad, but I just don't really like everything that they  have downstairs.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm really glad that we have the kitchens in Towers because I like being able to make my own food.
TrainSen	00100	 Now I'm back to worrying about what I am going to wear tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 I should have thought about this a lot sooner.
TrainSen	00100	 I tried to go get something yesterday, but I couldn't find anything.
TrainSen	00100	 From now on I am going to get all of my costumes together much sooner.
TrainSen	00100	 My problem is that everyone always goes to do all of that stuff in the afternoon and I always have class in the afternoon.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well though! I'm pretty excited about tonight, but I really just don't want to stay out too late.
TrainSen	00100	 And then one of my friends from high school is coming in to town on Friday so I think that should be really fun.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm excited to see her.
TrainSen	00100	 I've been feeling randomly kind of homesick lately, but I am going home for a visit in like 2 weeks and I can't wait! Now I am seriously getting so hungry.
TrainSen	00100	 As soon as I finish this I am going to make some lunch and I then I have to do some reading.
TrainSen	00100	 Reading is really the only homework I have, but it is so time consuming and I feel like I always kind of put it off.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know why I feel like that because I am not really behind in my reading or anything.
TrainSen	00100	 oh my, my alarm clock is going off and that is really annoying, I guess I never turned it off.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if there is anyone here.
TrainSen	00100	 I know my roommate is at class, but I'm not sure whether my suitemates are here or not.
TrainSen	00100	 It's really quiet so I'm thinking maybe not.
TrainSen	00100	 I am definitely going to go get a Coke and some lunch after I finish with this.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so tired, maybe the Coke will wake me up a little bit.
TrainSen	00100	 Goodness, I just wish I knew what I was going to wear tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 I think maybe I'll call my sister later and see what she thinks.
TrainSen	00100	 I just don't know though.
TrainSen	00100	 My Zeta Bud never called me which is strange, but I can't go to the activity today anyway because I have class.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00100	 I think someone just walked in.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder which one of my roommates is here.
TrainSen	00100	 I will have to go check on that and then I have a lot to do before my class at 2.
TrainSen	00100	 I also need to find a map to where I am supposed to go for my Seminar discussion today.
TrainSen	00100	It was a really humid day today while I was walking around on campus, but now since I'm at home looking out my window, I see so many people coming home from campus, getting off the bus with water bottles.
TrainSen	00100	 I realized that Texas weather is crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 At one point it's humid and then the next it is super hot.
TrainSen	00100	 It's nice and clear now.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm sure its not that hot because it's going to be 6 pretty soon and it cools down around this time.
TrainSen	00100	 Earlier today I thought it was going to rain.
TrainSen	00100	 I really don't like walking around in the rain.
TrainSen	00100	 My first day of class at UT it rained and I didn't know where I was going I was really miserable.
TrainSen	00100	 Before you get home you get soaking wet and then the AC units are on all around campus so your freeze through your classes.
TrainSen	00100	 Sometimes I wonder how the students at UT feel away from home.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that my first semester here I was extremely homesick.
TrainSen	00100	 I hated living away from home even though I was only 30 minutes away.
TrainSen	00100	 I lived in an apt my first year and I regret the fact that I didn't live in a dorm because I would have gotten to meet so many more people that way.
TrainSen	00100	 But then again I liked living in an apartment because I had my own space.
TrainSen	00100	 I didn't have to share a bathroom with anyone and it sure wasn't a crowded community with only two people in 1200 square feet area.
TrainSen	00100	 My freshman year I didn't meet very many people, but my second year I was introduced to so many more people and I started enjoying college rather than just staying at home and reading or doing homework and watching tv.
TrainSen	00100	 There's been a big change from then and now.
TrainSen	00100	 I actually like to stay in austin instead of going home on the weekends because I always have something to do.
TrainSen	00100	 At home I get bored very easily.
TrainSen	00100	 Of course I still miss my parents but its so different here with all my friends.
TrainSen	00100	 All kinds of crazy actions go on.
TrainSen	00100	 College life it super busy.
TrainSen	00100	 This semester I feel is going to fly by.
TrainSen	00100	 Before I know it I will be on Thanksgiving break then studying for finals and then home again in two weeks after that.
TrainSen	00100	 Sometimes I feel like I need to be more active in school programs and associations.
TrainSen	00100	 I never have time though.
TrainSen	00100	 Something is always coming up.
TrainSen	00100	 I have a load of homework or a test coming up that stops me from attending these functions, or most of the time I am just way too tired to do anything.
TrainSen	00100	 For example, right now I wish I was lying in my bed taking a nap because I'll probably have to hit the books as soon as I'm done with this writing assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 I never knew twenty minutes would take this long.
TrainSen	00100	 Twenty minutes is a very long time.
TrainSen	00100	 As you can probably tell I am getting very restless.
TrainSen	00100	 I have very short patience.
TrainSen	00100	 I like to take care of my business and get going on to the next.
TrainSen	00100	 Time can be very crucial sometimes.
TrainSen	00100	 When I'm late to class I wish I had more time to take are of all my stuff before I have to head out but other time when I have too much time on my hands I wish I had some chores to do or homework, despise the fact that homework can be a killer sometimes.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't like the way this apartment is never the right temperature.
TrainSen	00100	 It is always too cold or always too hot.
TrainSen	00100	 It is never the right temperature.
TrainSen	00100	 I think its because all of the rooms in this apartment are at different angles so they get cold and hot and different rates so my roommates and I always change the temperature on the thermostat according to how we each want it.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well I guess that's the way it works.
TrainSen	00100	 I just looked at the timer and I have a minute or so left so now I'm thinking about time and going totally blank on my other thoughts.
TrainSen	00100	 It's nice to randomly talk about different stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 It's unusual but good writing assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 Kinda funny that I sat here and typed away for a good twenty minutes, and I just got stopped so I guess that's it.
TrainSen	00001	I just started playing the Smiths.
TrainSen	00001	 I kind of consciously did that because I wanted to see how that would make me feel while doing this assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 I think it would be pretty funny if I had put whilst on that last sentence instead of while.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways, I had to put it down now because I'm now conscious of the fact that I started listening to the Smiths so I could say I was listening to them whilst typing this.
TrainSen	00001	 There I did it, I put whilst.
TrainSen	00001	 I also kinda put the Smiths on here probably so that if someone reads this then they'll know     I listen to the Smiths.
TrainSen	00001	 I do that a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 I specific music whenever people around, I don't know, I guess so they'll think it's cool or something.
TrainSen	00001	 I've been feeling really lonely recently.
TrainSen	00001	 I was thinking about that because I wonder if anyone is going to read this, and if they do, if all this stuff being collected is going to be used so we can learn something about ourselves.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't really want to hide anything, because I'd rather someone tell me what the hell is wrong with me, than type jive like, oh I don't know what to write, blah blah, school was fun today, because I feel really fucked up recently.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't want things to change, this shit is so gay.
TrainSen	00001	 Sorry, I know we're supposed to type thoughts but that's still pretty bad.
TrainSen	00001	 I was happy this summer with a girlfriend and my friends around, but then we had to break up because she went away for college, and I freaked out on her which wasn't cool, but I was just really scared.
TrainSen	00001	 Yes, this song is awesome.
TrainSen	00001	 I should probably go to the mental health center, but I'm scared of the process of signing up for an appointment, probably more than actually telling someone something, because then I have to talk to real people and I'm not so good at that.
TrainSen	00001	 That's why I'm really lonely lately, I don't know how to talk to people, and I'm meeting all these new people, and I have no idea what to say, so I just don't say anything.
TrainSen	00001	 I'd kind of really like to meet some new people, because I hate sitting around my room all the time, even though that's all I do.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm scared to like walk up and talk to someone though.
TrainSen	00001	 It's quite a frightening experience, and I get all nervous when I'm around people.
TrainSen	00001	 This typing is really hurting my shoulder because I'm on my laptop.
TrainSen	00001	 Shit, I just hit the back button.
TrainSen	00001	 Alright, I'm going to keep typing, but this is really gay, now I got to tack on another 10 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 Whoever reads this is probably going to be pissed that they have to read a 1/3 more than everyone else.
TrainSen	00001	 Well, I better not get in trouble for it is all I can say.
TrainSen	00001	 Speaking of gay, I called my girlfriend, I guess ex-girlfriend, because I want to keep in touch with her, and she told me about how she saw this guy with a Dashboard Confessional sticker and a Smiths sticker on his backpack, and she told me about how she and her new friend went up to him and asked him if he actually listened to good music or not, it being assumed that Dashboard Confession is pretty crappy, (and who's to blame that assumption, with lyrics like, Far away from all the stupid questions / 'Hey, did you get some' / Man that is so dumb"") nonetheless, what the hell is she talking about, she didn't even know who the Smiths were until like a month ago when I told her about them, and I mean, I still think it's funny, but a lot of the music she is into now is from me.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know, I think I am just pissed off because she wanted to break up.
TrainSen	00001	 But, it's perfectly reasonable, we're completely across the country,  I'm being ridiculous I know, it just ended so fast, and I'm still upset.
TrainSen	00001	 Ahh, this isn't fair, I still have 13 minutes left because I hit back somehow, this is going to take forever.
TrainSen	00001	 My shoulder is kind of starting to hurt, I think this is a really cool assignment, because it's just stream of consciousness, but it's taking forever, Agamemnon.
TrainSen	00001	 That's what I say when I'm saying Aggh, or something, because it sounds cooler.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't stop thinking about my girlfriend.
TrainSen	00001	 I really think I have some sort of problem with dependence, I feel like I HAVE to be around people most of the time or I start to feel sort of depressed, like no one cares about me.
TrainSen	00001	 This being away from some of my friends and alone in this new environment, is making things worse.
TrainSen	00001	 My History of the Banjo teacher, that's a freshman seminar, told us we had to grow our nails out longer to play the banjo, and it's driving me crazy, because     I hate semi-long nails, they always feel dirty, and I can feel them now whilst I type, clacking against the keys, it's irritating.
TrainSen	00001	 I think there's something wrong with my smell, I don't think I can smell anything.
TrainSen	00001	 That wouldn't be surprising anyways, I think there's something wrong with everything about me and everything I do.
TrainSen	00001	 I always seem to fail at anything I try, I can get good grades, but I've been missing assignments in college already, which is just compounding things and making things worse.
TrainSen	00001	 aggh, or I mean agamemnon.
TrainSen	00001	 I keep looking at this scratch on my arm, where I cut myself with a razor.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't think I'll do that again, I was feeling really depressed on Saturday, I didn't eat anything all weekend, and I normally regimen my meals very carefully, but I didn't eat anything, and feeling depressed and having read about self-injury, I wanted to try it, but cutting myself with a razor didn't feel particularly painful or punishing, and hardly seemed worth the effort involved, considering you have to clean up the blood, so I don't think I'll bother with that again.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't even do that right.
TrainSen	00001	 I've actually been feeling better the rest of this week, but I kinda want to talk to someone, just because I don't think there's any guarantee I won't feel like I did on Saturday again, and I felt terrible Saturday morning.
TrainSen	00001	 That was until I did DXM, which of course made me realize that things will eventually work themselves out.
TrainSen	00001	 I just wish I could manage to carry that feeling over into the real world, because not worrying about things is such a beautiful feeling.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I worry too much, but I'm always sure that as soon as I get by myself no one's going to ever want to see me again and I'll be stuck like that.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I could meet some people here, but I don't know what to say.
TrainSen	00001	 It's hard to just talk to someone, it's always boring conversation, and at the end, they always go their own way, and never want to do something with you again.
TrainSen	00001	 No matter how good you try to make the conversation, they never seem to want to continue after that, despite reading constantly that the way to make friends is to simply talk to someone.
TrainSen	00001	 Bullshit.
TrainSen	10000	This is my first year here at the University of Texas and I am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations.
TrainSen	10000	 It is so hard for me because I have had to learn how to get around in such a large town, on such a huge campus, and living on my own for the first time is crazy.
TrainSen	10000	 I have to find a job because I need to be able to pay my bills and I still have so much school work that I have to keep up with.
TrainSen	10000	 At the Junior College I attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to.
TrainSen	10000	 Here everything is done over the computer which I guess is good since we are in the electronic age, but I just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face.
TrainSen	10000	 I miss my family, especially my sister.
TrainSen	10000	 I moved here by myself and I really don't know anybody here in Austin.
TrainSen	10000	 I've never had to do so much walking in my life!  I guess I should get all the exercise that I need walking back and forth to my classes.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up in classes.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and I'm still very overwhelmed by all of it.
TrainSen	10000	 I just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things.
TrainSen	10000	 Twenty minutes is a long time to write.
TrainSen	10000	 I never thought I would feel pressured to think.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess my thoughts don't come that often or just don't continue for twenty minutes straight.
TrainSen	10000	 I still have ten more minutes to write.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder how these will be graded.
TrainSen	10000	 I have so much to do today.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to wash clothes, go to the grocery store, I have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend, and I have a test I have to start studying for.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope the test won't be too difficult.
TrainSen	10000	 I always worry about the first tests in a class.
TrainSen	10000	 They pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester.
TrainSen	10000	 If you do really bad, then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester, if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish that all teachers would do a review.
TrainSen	10000	 Reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because I end up going over it again and again.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess its really repetition that makes me learn.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I still have five more minutes to write.
TrainSen	10000	 I have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class.
TrainSen	10000	 I was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class.
TrainSen	10000	 I bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size.
TrainSen	10000	 There must be so many distractions for the professor because I know I get distracted just sitting there.
TrainSen	10000	 In an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes, sometimes your focus drifts away.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that I'm going to like this class.
TrainSen	10000	 It seems like it will be interesting and fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that if every class was interesting and fun, then the college would be full of 4.
TrainSen	10000	 0 students walking down the street.
TrainSen	10000	 My finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least.
TrainSen	10000	Man these computer labs on campus are so sad, everybody seems dead.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess its probably because its sunday.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel tired too wish I could go to sleep.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I would if I didn't have all this work to do.
TrainSen	10000	 can't believe its already 2 weeks into school.
TrainSen	10000	 it still feels like summer.
TrainSen	10000	 well I guess before I know it its going to be finals.
TrainSen	10000	 man  I need to call nathan and get that HW of him.
TrainSen	10000	 wow that girl is pretty hot.
TrainSen	10000	 she probably is not that hot but I guess being in the engineering school you got to accept what you can get.
TrainSen	10000	 man I wish I didn't do engineering.
TrainSen	10000	 can't believe its been 4 years.
TrainSen	10000	 I really hate it but I guess it will get me a job.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess that is why I did engineering.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I had done architecture.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't draw but still its seems so much more fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I used to suck at drawing in high school.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess its a talent.
TrainSen	10000	 man I wish those two girls would shut up they have been liking whispering for 20 minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 I hate people who whisper I rather them just talk loud, even though its lab.
TrainSen	10000	 its very irritating.
TrainSen	10000	 thank god she left.
TrainSen	10000	 man I can't believe dallas lost that game.
TrainSen	10000	 they played so damn carp.
TrainSen	10000	 so much for paying bill parcells 17million bucks.
TrainSen	10000	 they are never going to win if they don't get a new QB.
TrainSen	10000	 carter sucks, its been like 3yrs they should realize he can't play.
TrainSen	10000	 well screw it.
TrainSen	10000	 I  so want to be done with school, I can't believe these freshman classes.
TrainSen	10000	 they all look like a bunch of kids, they seem so damn enthusiastic and happy to be in school.
TrainSen	10000	 it will be funny to see them in 4 years and see what they think then.
TrainSen	10000	 that girl in government class, I have never seen somebody so happy to be taking a class.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if I was like this when is was freshman.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I was excited to be in college.
TrainSen	10000	 always wanting to party and stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 but I don't know if I was as crazy as sara's sister.
TrainSen	10000	 she is well on her way to the freshman 15.
TrainSen	10000	 crazy girl.
TrainSen	10000	 but I don't think I partied as much, maybe I did.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel old.
TrainSen	10000	 I really need to get out of austin.
TrainSen	10000	 getting tired of this town.
TrainSen	10000	My window is just above my bed.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't see the stars but the lights of the city substitute nicely.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish my bed were higher so I could lay in it and look out the window over the city.
TrainSen	10000	 This is the one place that I feel on top of the world even though lately my world has been crumbling down.
TrainSen	10000	 I see the cars going by, some steadily others as though they were racing.
TrainSen	10000	 and the last remind me of my drum major in high school who used to yell at us for lollygagging.
TrainSen	10000	 "" I imagine they are going to exciting places.
TrainSen	10000	 Places where they don't worry if their boyfriend is cheating on them or why they can't seem to motivate themselves to do the assigned readings for class.
TrainSen	10000	 I pretend for them.
TrainSen	10000	 I make them my social group.
TrainSen	10000	 I have named the girl who sits on the wall outside dobie Lisa.
TrainSen	10000	 I think its a nice name.
TrainSen	10000	 She is always out there to smoke cigarettes, I imagine because her roommate is the type that is anal and can't stand to have the rules bent much less broken.
TrainSen	10000	 Lisa hates that.
TrainSen	10000	 That is why she wears shorts 2 sizes to small that make her legs dimple while she is perched atop the wall.
TrainSen	10000	 I am lonely.
TrainSen	10000	 When I look out my window I feel like everyone else is too.
TrainSen	10000	 We are a disjointed people connected by this city, these lights and sounds that are the stuff of civilization.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm sure someone else is in that blue building with the step-like structure.
TrainSen	10000	 sitting somewhere looking out, feeling the same as me.
TrainSen	10000	 I like it when it rains, when the sky is heavy and dark and sad.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish it would rain here.
TrainSen	10000	 I have never seen that from my window.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that I might like to live in a tall building like this later on in life, but I would have to live there alone.
TrainSen	10000	 Its hard to bask in my emotions while my roommate debates who loves who more with her feminine boyfriend before they discuss what they're going to do for their umpteenth month anniversary.
TrainSen	10000	 My suitemate fits me better.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel how she acts, but I can't express myself that way for too many reasons.
TrainSen	10000	 one very big one being my excessively religious parents.
TrainSen	10000	 They would flip.
TrainSen	10000	 No one understands my thoughts.
TrainSen	10000	 I care so much more about the whys than the what is, but I act the opposite.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I could do nothing but read all day.
TrainSen	10000	 I'd go in the living room in the pappazan or however you spell it chair by the window in there-but it would have to be higher too--to see out the window.
TrainSen	10000	 That is what connects me, keeps me here, keeps me from floating away.
TrainSen	10000	 So I would sit there and I would read.
TrainSen	10000	 I would go all sorts of places and be all sorts of people but my window would be my anchor as I sailed through these many parallel universes.
TrainSen	10000	 I think my favorite would be in a Jane Austen novel.
TrainSen	10000	 they're so warm.
TrainSen	10000	 There's such a sense of how to act without ever having to think.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I didn't think.
TrainSen	10000	 I try to keep myself so busy that I don't, but my mind won't be constrained.
TrainSen	10000	 Its only controlled by the window, my looking glass sanctuary.
TrainSen	10000	 Its solitude without loneliness.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel the most lonely with lots of people.
TrainSen	10000	 on the south mall at noon, walking to class.
TrainSen	10000	 So many people with such well put together lives, purposeful strides and slender hips.
TrainSen	10000	 I watch them.
TrainSen	10000	 I am behind a tree.
TrainSen	10000	 I wear long skirts to cover what I wish wasn't there, with my thick dark hair pulled back, tugging on my wrinkled shirt that won't ever stay into place.
TrainSen	10000	 I am magic though, I have powers.
TrainSen	10000	 I can be invisible.
TrainSen	10000	 No one ever knows that I'm there.
TrainSen	10000	 No one ever knows I'm at my window with its menagerie of colored lights.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know about anything anymore.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish someone would just tell me what I'm supposed to do.
TrainSen	10000	 that there was some fated order of things.
TrainSen	10000	 That would be easy to accept, that is why we have religion.
TrainSen	10000	 It gives you all the whys and leaves you only the what is.
TrainSen	10000	 but for some of us that won't suffice.
TrainSen	10000	 No doctrine will halt the whys of my mind, I will always wonder about it if not the things it claims.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm confused and lonely and at my window.
TrainSen	10000	 It doesn't make sense.
TrainSen	10000	 But tomorrow I'll get up and I'll go to class.
TrainSen	10000	 I'll say hi to all my friends and smile.
TrainSen	10000	 The weird thing is I'll even enjoy it and be distracted so that I only focus on the what is.
TrainSen	10000	 I'll watch TV and do homework, and probably even go to a club with the cute guy I can't ever date because he happens to be my untrustworthy boyfriends cousin.
TrainSen	10000	 (yes there are so many problems).
TrainSen	10000	 But then I'll go to bed.
TrainSen	10000	 I'll lie and look out the pane that sensitizes me to my pain, and I'll think about all the whys of my life and how I'll probably never figure them out, just how to distract myself from them.
TrainSen	10000	I am thinking right now that this is kind of difficult.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't want everyone to know my personal thoughts.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I have to do it anyway to make a good grade on this.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to get everything done so that I can go home.
TrainSen	10000	 I have to clean my room and do the psychology experiment, which takes a long long time.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know what to expect from it either.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well, it's required so I am going to do it.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't wait to go home because when I do I get a snow cone.
TrainSen	10000	 That might sound juvenile to be happy about something like that, but there are a lot of people who like them.
TrainSen	10000	 I especially like pink lemonade with ice cream in the middle.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I might get that.
TrainSen	10000	 I always get it though.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I don't like to try new things.
TrainSen	10000	 This is actually kind of fun.
TrainSen	10000	 My friend Monica is in this class too.
TrainSen	10000	 Are ya'll going to take off for backspaces?  I don't even know if ya'll can see when we erase stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 I am a fast typer, but I make a lot of mistakes.
TrainSen	10000	 That's why I am saying that I erase.
TrainSen	10000	 My friend Monica also made me a cd.
TrainSen	10000	 It's really good.
TrainSen	10000	 It's funny because it has songs on it that apply to my life.
TrainSen	10000	 Well not necessarily my life, but a boy in my life.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm very confused about him.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm not saying that he is gay.
TrainSen	10000	 I just don't know what to do.
TrainSen	10000	 It seems that I have been thinking and talking about him all the time.
TrainSen	10000	 I e-mailed him and everything.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that if you think about something too much it gets boring after awhile.
TrainSen	10000	 You just confused yourself even more.
TrainSen	10000	 What happened with him is that we liked each other, but I didn't know what I wanted from our relationship and so I guess I got scared.
TrainSen	10000	 Now I don't know what to do.
TrainSen	10000	 I always say that if it is meant to be it will be later.
TrainSen	10000	 God is the only one that knows the future.
TrainSen	10000	 That's what I don't like.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I just knew all the answers to everything.
TrainSen	10000	 Man I just lost my train of thought.
TrainSen	10000	 That's not cool.
TrainSen	10000	 Anyway this writing assignment is pretty easy.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it helps to get things out.
TrainSen	10000	 We think a lot.
TrainSen	10000	 Gahlee.
TrainSen	10000	 My grammar is bad.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well, it doesn't really matter.
TrainSen	10000	 Let me think of something else to talk about.
TrainSen	10000	 Hmmmmm, I guess I can talk about my room mate.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe tell stories.
TrainSen	10000	 Not bad ones of course.
TrainSen	10000	 I'll write down how we met.
TrainSen	10000	 I was really afraid that I would be shy at orientation since I was in high school.
TrainSen	10000	 High school was crap.
TrainSen	10000	 I wasn't made fun of and stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 I was just ready to get out of there.
TrainSen	10000	 I went to orientation and she was my roommate there because we are both in Preview which is a group that takes summer school and they pay for everything except for $350 of it.
TrainSen	10000	 It actually helps you a lot.
TrainSen	10000	 You get 6 hours of credit for $350 and you make a lot of friends.
TrainSen	10000	 That's actually where I met that guy.
TrainSen	10000	 Monica and I got a long really well.
TrainSen	10000	 It seems that we are exactly alike.
TrainSen	10000	 That's really cool.
TrainSen	10000	 She lives in San Antonio.
TrainSen	10000	 Well, she is from there she lives here.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok so we met and I was pretty outgoing which is a good thing.
TrainSen	10000	 I have changed a lot.
TrainSen	10000	 I changed when I got here.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that is weird because usually it takes me a long time to get used to a place.
TrainSen	10000	 You get off track in these things easily.
TrainSen	10000	 I was just thinking a second ago about how I went to my pal teacher's class and it threw me off.
TrainSen	10000	 I thought of it because I talked about how different it has been coming here.
TrainSen	10000	 My friend and I went to her class so that we could see her and she ended up making us talk about college.
TrainSen	10000	 I miss Pals so much.
TrainSen	10000	 It was a lot of fun just really difficult sometimes.
TrainSen	10000	 It was kind of like Preview in a way.
TrainSen	10000	 People could get in your business easily.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't stand it when people don't mind their own business.
TrainSen	10000	 That's funny because I am really nosey myself.
TrainSen	10000	 Not in the sense that I like to learn everything about everyone's personal lives just that I am curious about everything.
TrainSen	10000	 I really like this cd.
TrainSen	10000	 She did a good job.
TrainSen	10000	 Daniel, Monica's b/f is coming to visit her this withe.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope that ya'll know what b/f and withe mean.
TrainSen	10000	 Monica really likes him I think.
TrainSen	10000	 He seems like a really sweet guy.
TrainSen	10000	 The guy that I like is sweet too.
TrainSen	10000	 I haven't even said his name yet.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I should but somethings need to remain private.
TrainSen	10000	 Then again it's not like ya'll would know who he is.
TrainSen	10000	 Awww friends are friends forever.
TrainSen	10000	 I love this song.
TrainSen	10000	 It's so sweet.
TrainSen	10000	 Man my time is almost up that's not fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I like doing this.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm singing in my head.
TrainSen	10000	 I would type that out but it would take too long.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder who else likes this song.
TrainSen	00100	Here I sit in the Jester computer lab, wishing that I didn't have to     be here.
TrainSen	00100	 Why don't I have a computer, better yet, why don't I have a     friend that will let me use their computers? College is not like what I     thought it would be.
TrainSen	00100	 It definitely is as hard as I thought it might be,     school work wise, but I thought that the friends part would come     easily.
TrainSen	00100	 I have spent 14 years of my life living overseas with     americans.
TrainSen	00100	 It was a military base in Asia.
TrainSen	00100	 The people in Dodds     schools systems are incomparable to the people in America.
TrainSen	00100	 They     are open-minded and excepting.
TrainSen	00100	 I was raised to believe that all     man-kind was this way.
TrainSen	00100	 I figured than when I got to college I would     miss my old friends, but be glad to meet some more great people in     this world.
TrainSen	00100	 But here I sit, in this lab, alone.
TrainSen	00100	 It's not like what I     expected, and worse than I ever thought.
TrainSen	00100	 I walk around alone, and     although there are worse things,  I use to be known for being loud     and fun.
TrainSen	00100	 I was the person that everybody knew, and everybody liked.
TrainSen	00100	 I was somebody on my tiny base, and in my little high school of a     hundred people.
TrainSen	00100	 But here, I am another face in the crowd.
TrainSen	00100	 Of     course I didn't expect college to be just like Turkey (where my base     was), but I didn't expect to have no friends at all.
TrainSen	00100	 People haven't even     given me a chance here.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm just hoping that things get better.
TrainSen	00100	 They     say that everybody has the same fears that I do, but then I see a ton     of people hanging out with friends.
TrainSen	00100	 Not everybody is in my boat, all     of my friends are either across the Atlantic Ocean, or at least in     another state.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't want to be a pessimist, and I definitely don't     want to dwell on the bad, but it gets difficult when everything that I do     everyday is a reminder that I am alone.
TrainSen	00100	 And here I sit in the     computer room typing this thing, not because there isn't a computer     in my room, but because it is my room mate's, and she won't let me     use it.
TrainSen	00100	 I let her use anything of mine, I don't even understand how     people can actually be so stingy and be okay with themselves.
TrainSen	00100	 My     friends have always come before my possessions, and people's     feelings have always come first, and I always know when somebody     is feeling down, and I have always tried to help them.
TrainSen	00100	 I am waiting     for that what goes around, comes around"" saying to come into     action for me.
TrainSen	00100	 Also, I had decided to be a teacher overseas for my     life anyways, have my children grow up like me.
TrainSen	00100	 This has at least     cemented my life goals for me.
TrainSen	00100	 My children are definitely growing up     in a military school overseas.
TrainSen	00100	 The people there are very warm and     accepting, and living among cultures makes everyone open-minded.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't like the way that the people act here, and most of them don't     even realize what they are missing in this world.
TrainSen	00100	 They just turn up     their noses and avoid people who are different, and don't like any     kind of changes.
TrainSen	00100	 I have been through two evacuations from my     base, and I was just fine.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that I can probably handle a lot     more than other people, and had they been stuck in a situation like     mine, a new place with nobody that they know, they might be feeling     just like me.
TrainSen	00100	 But I do know that I will get over this, and I will feel even     more blessed to see my friends and live back overseas; and I will be     positive that I am doing the right thing when I give the life to my     children that I had growing up.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that it shaped my character in     a good way, and if anybody here were open-minded and accepting     enough to talk to me, maybe they would understand that as well.
TrainSen	00100	 anyways, I'm back, still here in this lab on this same computer.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm     still here in this school with no body that I know.
TrainSen	00100	 People keep on     coming in and out.
TrainSen	00100	 Do they maybe feel like I do? It is so weird to be     standing in a crowd of more than 500 people, and not knowing     anybody's name.
TrainSen	00100	 But that is 500 people that I could get to know if     they gave me the chance.
TrainSen	00100	 That thought use to make me happy, now     I hate the idea.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my old life.
TrainSen	00100	 But I wonder, if I feel like this,     there has to be at least one other person that feels like me.
TrainSen	00100	 One     other person who feels like they don't know anybody.
TrainSen	00100	 That thought     doesn't make me happy, but optimistic that maybe I will be able to     meet people sometime.
TrainSen	00100	 In the mean time, I am thankful for all of the     true friendships that I made during my time spent else where, and I     am glad that I at least have a loving family and friends to pick up the     phone and call, no matter how far they may reside from me, I know     that they care.
TrainSen	00100	 I no that no matter how alone I am on campus, I am     not alone in the world, and every night I go to sleep thinking of my     friends, and smiling.
TrainSen	00100	 And I know that in my four or five years here, I     will at least make one friend.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe even tomorrow, so I'm just going     to stop stressing about today, and pick up the phone and call a loved     one for now.
TrainSen	00001	Right now, I am sitting here sick to my stomach and the world feels so small.
TrainSen	00001	 I am waiting for a phone call that is so important, and if I don't get it, I am going to feel like a really big loser.
TrainSen	00001	 Yes, I did just get all the blessings I could ever ask for, so I am selfish to be wanting more, but its something I really really want.
TrainSen	00001	 All I want is to make my parents proud and to give my family something they can brag about.
TrainSen	00001	 I have spent my whole life wanting to achieve the best, and I get so sick when I let myself down.
TrainSen	00001	 Rejection sucks.
TrainSen	00001	 its so hot in here, and as all my friends call because they just got the call,"" I feel like a loser.
TrainSen	00001	 I am proud of myself- but rejection is not something I handle well? What if the call does not come-- will I cry, will I blame my inabilities on something else, how will I react? The anxiety I feel right now is extreme.
TrainSen	00001	 On top of all that, I am homesick.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a great life here in Austin, but since my family is a huge part of my life, I feel kind of left out being so far away.
TrainSen	00001	 Everything back home seems to go on without me.
TrainSen	00001	 my roommate here is annoying and the tv here is always on.
TrainSen	00001	 she follows me around and sometimes I feel used because she really does not know people here.
TrainSen	00001	 She is not in a sorority and so sometimes I feel as if she is angry at me for that.
TrainSen	00001	 I am so anxious.
TrainSen	00001	 my boyfriend is supportive too, but I wonder sometimes if he really has deep feelings for me.
TrainSen	00001	 Yes, I know about his fear of commitment and all that crap, but we have been together for way too long for me not to feel totally secure with him.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh, that stupid seventh heaven song.
TrainSen	00001	 turn off the dang tv.
TrainSen	00001	 All I want is peace and quiet without all the noise.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh, and I have to worry about yesterday too.
TrainSen	00001	 My sorority is awesome, but it makes me really uncomfortable to drink around some of them.
TrainSen	00001	 Yes, I know.
TrainSen	00001	 Its silly if we all drink together.
TrainSen	00001	 But, sometimes I feel as if I have this image that I have to uphold.
TrainSen	00001	 and that image reflects back onto all aspects of my life.
TrainSen	00001	 my family, my faith, my school, my friends.
TrainSen	00001	 How do I act? How do I dress? Who do I associate myself with? All of these things constantly flood my brain, and sometimes all I want to do is get far away from those thoughts.
TrainSen	00001	 Do people love me for me? Do they love me for who I am here or the grades I make or the house I live in or the money my parents make? How do people view me? And that tv, always on.
TrainSen	00001	 what I would give for that chatter to stop for 10 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't even study with the noise.
TrainSen	00001	 I am worried about this year.
TrainSen	00001	 I need a job, I have bills to pay, I am in hard classes.
TrainSen	00001	 how will I measure up? I love my life, I love my life.
TrainSen	00001	 but I could seriously do without the stress.
TrainSen	00001	 I am determined, and I already have accomplished so much this semester, but will it end? I want it to stay this way, but there is so much to lose.
TrainSen	00001	 I am scared that I will lose it.
TrainSen	00001	 How do I not lose it? I pray all the time, and I count my blessings.
TrainSen	00001	 its hot in my apartment and it smells like paint.
TrainSen	00001	 why did I choose to live in an apartment with a girl I don't like? What possessed me to do this? Did I feel independent and like a big girl? Now I feel young and naive, and way out of my league.
TrainSen	00001	 oh, the insanity, but good things come to those who wait and I put all my trust into a higher being so things WILL work out.
TrainSen	01000	I just woke up and I am feeling so drowsy.
TrainSen	01000	 I just went to a belly dancing show yesterday and I am thinking about how fun it was.
TrainSen	01000	 Man  that iranian guy at the club was so hot, I wish I could go up to him and talk to him, but I'm too scared.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I'd be rejected in two seconds.
TrainSen	01000	 He didn't even look at me, or did he? that dirty old arab guy was freaky though, he kept asking me to dance with him and that made me really uncomfortable.
TrainSen	01000	 I am really really hungry, and the droning of the refrigerator isn't making the situation any better.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm afraid to even open the refrigerator door because it smells so bad in there.
TrainSen	01000	 We really need baking soda.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if the chemistry test is going to be hard, I really hope I understand the difference between atoms and molecules and I don't completely blank out during the test.
TrainSen	01000	 This assignment is really cool, it's helping me empty out everything in my head.
TrainSen	01000	 it is extremely cold in here and I want to go talk to that guy on the second floor.
TrainSen	01000	 He was such a nice person and I haven't really met any Iranians here.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope the iranians in the ISACO club are nice and they aren't like all those fake iranian girls that dye their hair blonde and all have nose jobs and live at the mall.
TrainSen	01000	 That reminds me of Bahareh, she was such a rude, mean stupid girl.
TrainSen	01000	 She had no right in saying those things to me, and for some reason I can't get over it.
TrainSen	01000	 I am thinking of Erfon, I wonder what happened to him, he reminds me of Kourosh, I hope he doesn't become afraid of me like kourosh did though.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder why Kourosh is acting like that? I haven't talked to him in a really long time, he shouldn't be intimidated by me! Anyway my hand is beginning to hurt and my pants are really loose on me I think if I lose any more weight they will fall off! UT's campus really makes you work out man, I wouldn't have even lifted a finger if I had gone to a college in Houston, but this school makes you work.
TrainSen	01000	 I am taking a lot of science courses, and I hope I can handle it.
TrainSen	01000	 I talk to God at night and I hope he hears me, I hope he helps me get through all my classes successfully, I mean, my parents expect me to get all A's.
TrainSen	01000	 Dad said if I don't' come home with a 4.
TrainSen	01000	 0  GPA then I shouldn't even come home.
TrainSen	01000	 That's not fair and how come they always compare me to Neema? It's not fair that I'm known as the not so good"" kid, even though I've never done anything BAD in  my life.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean for God's sake I've never even gone on a date so why should they think I'm the ""BAD KID""? I guess it's because Neema gets along with mom so much better.
TrainSen	01000	 I really wish I had a good relationship with mom, it sucks how we can't get along ever.
TrainSen	01000	 She was right when she said yesterday that we can't stand each other for more than a few seconds a day.
TrainSen	01000	 We just don't understand each other, she keeps lecturing me and it pisses me off.
TrainSen	01000	 There is only so much one person can stand, you know? I can't take being lectured three hundred hours a day, it makes me sick, how would you like it if someone kept telling you bla bla don't do this bla bla don't do that.
TrainSen	01000	 Dad is so much easier to get along with, although he has a temper like a mofo and he is stubborn as hell! He is such a kind gentle man, I love my dad, he works so hard for our family, I hope to repay him with success.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope he lives forever, I hope they both live forever.
TrainSen	01000	 My legs are beginning to hurt and there is a piece of hair that has fallen on my arm and it tickles me! For some reason, I woke up this morning and my hair was curly, it was the strangest thing, usually my hair is a giant nappy fro, but today it was pretty and silky.
TrainSen	01000	 Ut isn't as humid as houston, and I'm glad.
TrainSen	01000	 Dude I really miss Nasim, she is such an awesome person.
TrainSen	01000	 I emailed her the other day, but she never ever checks her email.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder why I never call anyone! I feel so rude when people call me and tell me, ""uh how come you haven't called us that's so inconsiderate"" but I'm just not a phone person, I guess.
TrainSen	01000	 I really should call people back and let them know I care, I think I get this aspect of my character from mom because she doesn't like calling people either.
TrainSen	01000	 It's not that I don't like talking to my friends, it's just that I never think to call them.
TrainSen	01000	 I will though, definitely, today I will call sogol and ponta and nasim.
TrainSen	01000	 I will call stephanie and jennifer and batool.
TrainSen	01000	 Well I'm sitting in a room that is covered with various books and study guides and it's all a bit overwhelming.
TrainSen	01000	 I really hope I can handle everything, although, I seem to switch out of every class I think is too hard.
TrainSen	01000	 which is really a dumb thing to do because it means I can't handle challenges.
TrainSen	01000	 I really need to swallow my fear and just take risks.
TrainSen	01000	 I would take risks although all my friends are grandmas and they are so cautious that I think it might be rubbing of on me too.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to go find friends that don't mind driving around campus at 2 a.
TrainSen	01000	 m.
TrainSen	01000	 but I don't want friends that drink.
TrainSen	01000	 What on earth is up with drinking? what is so great about it? There is no way in hell I'm going to drink.
TrainSen	01000	 So many people have told me ""oh don't worry marjon, you'll start drinking when you get in college"" Uhhh no I'm not, I think I know myself better than anyone else knows me and I know I'm not going to drink.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't even think I'm going to date, I'm so afraid of rejection.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been rejected a million times before in my own head that I can't fathom going out and actually trying to get a date.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean I don't really know if people reject me, I think I'm being paranoid when I say that, sometimes a flicker of someone's eye sparks me off and I think they don't like me.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess that makes me kind of insecure, or paranoid.
TrainSen	01000	 Sometimes I make too much of situations, I over analyze and I think that what was a casual gesture was a gesture of hate? I don't know what I'm getting at here, perhaps I am not a very good judge of character.
TrainSen	01000	 Although if I weren't a good judge of character than I would have horrible friends.
TrainSen	01000	 Like nasim, nasim's friends are absolutely terrible, they teach her bad things and they put holes in her brain.
TrainSen	01000	 She is such a pretty girl I wish she had stray away from that stuff and start studying so that she can come to UT.
TrainSen	01000	 Man if you have brains and beauty, that's a big plus in this world, everything in America is aesthetic, I've noticed that.
TrainSen	01000	 People are more inclined to talk to you if you are pretty.
TrainSen	01000	 People don't give a crap about you if you aren't pretty.
TrainSen	01000	 It's so superficial and stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish people's inner beauty could shine through, because most of the really gorgeous girls aren't deep.
TrainSen	01000	 they are like a pond they are so shallow.
TrainSen	00100	As of right now, I'm pretty happy with my life.
TrainSen	00100	 The only thing that I question are relationship issues.
TrainSen	00100	 After breaking up with my long-time girlfriend 6 months ago, I haven't dated any other person.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I'm just lonely and miss the having a girlfriend"" lifestyle.
TrainSen	00100	 The girls I have met as friends I might have considered them possible girlfriend-material when in actuality they weren't, again because I missed having a girlfriend.
TrainSen	00100	 Recently, I've gotten over the issue a bit.
TrainSen	00100	 I've spent time with all my friends.
TrainSen	00100	 That's the good thing about being single, you have more time for your friends.
TrainSen	00100	 When I was going out for my ex, which by the way the relationship lasted nearly 3 years, I didn't have much time for friends.
TrainSen	00100	 Not only that, but I chose to be with my girlfriend as opposed to my friends.
TrainSen	00100	 This issue of mine, it's made me a bit more self conscious.
TrainSen	00100	 I got the idea in my head that looks really do matter.
TrainSen	00100	 Seriously though, having a ""deep"" relationship is important and yadda yadda,but I really do feel that looks matter too.
TrainSen	00100	 A friend and I were discussing this.
TrainSen	00100	 She is been there for me a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 When I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, she was there for me to complain to.
TrainSen	00100	 Anyways, she said that looks don't matter and it only matters a small percentage of time.
TrainSen	00100	 I argued with her saying that she is right that looks are only a small percentage but unfortunately that's what matters at the very beginning.
TrainSen	00100	 I met this very interesting girl this summer.
TrainSen	00100	 Her name is Serena.
TrainSen	00100	 She was telling me about her past, how she was somewhat of a ""geek"" in high school.
TrainSen	00100	 She didn't care about her looks or anything.
TrainSen	00100	 She is a very bright girl, very deep.
TrainSen	00100	 Likes art and many things most girls just don't take interest anymore.
TrainSen	00100	 She said that she realized she felt she HAD to start dressing up to attract people first, then and only then would they be able to see the ""real"" side of her.
TrainSen	00100	 I completely agree with this.
TrainSen	00100	 There is no way people can see the real side of you unless they give you a chance and unfortunately being given a chance means you have to attract them somehow.
TrainSen	00100	 Ever since then, I've gotten a bit obsessed with my physical features.
TrainSen	00100	 I never did care about it much.
TrainSen	00100	 I was in a long relationship so thoughts of attracting others didn't really enter my mind.
TrainSen	00100	 During this recent period, I've started to lift weights a bit and work out my body.
TrainSen	00100	 Another thought of relationships I've always wondered is at what point do you really have to ""settle""? The reality is that most likely you will never find the perfect girl.
TrainSen	00100	 When you date someone, how far into the future should you consider? Unfortunately for me, I should've realized in my last relationship that there was no future.
TrainSen	00100	 Instead, because of my fear of being alone, I stayed with her.
TrainSen	00100	 for nearly 3 years.
TrainSen	00100	 It was fun and all, but we had many arguments.
TrainSen	00100	 The reality was we were two different people.
TrainSen	00100	 Two different backgrounds, interests, ideas, practically everything.
TrainSen	00100	 My parents didn't like her because she wasn't chinese and wasn't very bright.
TrainSen	00100	 (I'm Chinese by the way).
TrainSen	00100	 I'd like to talk about my family for a second.
TrainSen	00100	 I was born in Taiwan, and moved to the USA when I was four.
TrainSen	00100	 Thus, I speak/write fluent English but can only speak chinese(Mandarin) since I still speak it at home.
TrainSen	00100	 I would like to think that my family is still pretty traditional, which I really like.
TrainSen	00100	 Like most chinese families, my parents stressed educational when I was growing up.
TrainSen	00100	 Sometimes I think this is why there is the stereotype of ""asians being smarter in school"".
TrainSen	00100	 I think it's because traditionally, chinese families stress education a bit more than others.
TrainSen	00100	 The bad thing about growing up in a ""traditional"" family is that living in the USA, I did not experience certain American family activities.
TrainSen	00100	 My dad never took me fishing, camping, or anything ""fatherly"".
TrainSen	00100	 I think that was one of the things I really disliked about him.
TrainSen	00100	 Growing up, I always favored my mom more.
TrainSen	00100	 Now that I'm in college, I talk to my dad a lot more when I go back home, including cars, sports, politics, etc.
TrainSen	00100	 Going home, I'm spoiled with food.
TrainSen	00100	 My mom is always thinking I'm going to starve to death.
TrainSen	00100	 Everytime I come back up to Austin, she makes me bring a whole bunch of food.
TrainSen	00100	 My grandparents(dad's side) also lives very close to me in Houston.
TrainSen	00100	 My grandparents came to the USA a couple of years before us, which is how we were able to.
TrainSen	00100	 I remember growing up and laying awake at night, my biggest fear in the world was that I'd lose my grandpa (to old age).
TrainSen	00100	 It's still my biggest fear because he is been an avid smoker since almost forever.
TrainSen	00100	 We've tried to tell him to quit and he knows its bad for him, but he just won't.
TrainSen	00100	 He says he has nothing better to do during the daytime, and to let him enjoy it.
TrainSen	00100	 He is even said something close to ""I've already experienced everything in life.
TrainSen	00100	 My family is doing good.
TrainSen	00100	 I have nothing else to live for"" Now, don't take this to be a suicidal comment for anything, he was saying it as if it were wise words.
TrainSen	00100	 On my part, its hard to argue with him.
TrainSen	00100	 He is my grandpa and I can't really tell him to just stop what he likes so much.
TrainSen	00100	 Personally, I have a very big problem with talking to people.
TrainSen	00100	 This problem has been solved a bit ever since coming to college.
TrainSen	00100	 Since there are so many people around, it's hard to not get use to it.
TrainSen	00100	 When I'm around people, I'm always worried that what I say will make them think negatively of me.
TrainSen	00100	 That's why I'll usually always rethink what I want to say in my mind before I actually say it.
TrainSen	00100	 Funny thing is, my chinese name translated to english is ""brave speaker"".
TrainSen	00100	 I know I have a problem with caring too much what others think of me but I just can't help it.
TrainSen	00100	 Growing up I didn't have that many friends, so I thought to myself a lot and that's still true.
TrainSen	00100	 Around strangers, I'm really quiet.
TrainSen	00100	 Only around friends am I a bit more active.
TrainSen	00100	 And my 20 minutes are up.
TrainSen	00100	 This was pretty useful.
TrainSen	00100	 Glad I could type out what I was thinking.
TrainSen	00100	 Now I got to go get caught up on reading those boring chapters from the psychology book.
TrainSen	00100	 The lectures are much more interesting.
TrainSen	10000	Well, I am almost ready to leave tomorrow back to my house in fort worth, although I would like it to be better to go back because since I have to work tomorrow, that makes it kind of boring and I cannot stop thinking about work instead of enjoy my time over there.
TrainSen	10000	 Every time I go I always expect to spend some time with my girlfriend, that actually never really happens, I don't really know how I feel about it because sometimes I feel frustrated that I cannot do anything about it but then I analyze the circumstances and then everything gets better in my head.
TrainSen	10000	 The fist thing I have to do before I leave is get all my homework done, including this assignment that I didn't want to leave for tomorrow because then it would keep me awake all night just like all my homework does.
TrainSen	10000	 Since the first day that I slept in this dorm, it seems that the bed is not for me or something, I cannot fall asleep, and if I do, I wake up every 20 min and look at my clock to see if it's time to go to class.
TrainSen	10000	 I remember I used to love school when I was in high school last year, everything was so cool, nothing was going so bad to call it bad, grades, girlfriend, family MONEY, but now some times I feel so ready to just drop out and get all this stuff over with, I cannot handle so much stress, never had so much actually.
TrainSen	10000	 anyways, the only thing that keeps me up is my own will because I know I'm not a failer.
TrainSen	10000	 Hard times are only tests that will lead me to a high hill and then the way down will feel really good!.
TrainSen	10000	 The biggest problem that I have and that I think already gave me a pain in my neck, well that's because I cannot sleep and keep on moving at nights so  I think that my neck pain is indirectly related to my economic problems.
TrainSen	10000	 I have to pay my whole semester rent next monday, that's one of the reasons I'm going home tomorrow, to get a juicy check that will just fly away from my hands.
TrainSen	10000	 I only I was living in my house and going to a college near, I would be able to keep all that money and use it to get rid of my debt and actually be able to buy a gift for my girlfriend.
TrainSen	10000	 I have bunches of pictures of her all around my room.
TrainSen	10000	 I also have pictures of my mother and little sister.
TrainSen	10000	 she is 6 and I miss her.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope tonight I can fall asleep easy so I won't be tired during my 2 hour drive.
TrainSen	10000	 everytime I drive tired I get nervous and think that I may fall asleep and all these thoughts come to my mind that I'm going to crash a big truck and never make it home.
TrainSen	10000	 I know that the odds are really small and then I get better once I start listening to this exact same music I'm listening to right now.
TrainSen	10000	 its a band called mana, is from mexico and they play really good kidda alternative music but is really meaningful and then they talk about world peace and they help children with massive foundations, with no doubt my favorite band.
TrainSen	10000	 they are coming to dallas next october, I can't wait till then to go to the concert, I went to one last november and I still remember almost every second of it, this time I'm thinking on taking my girlfriend to make the concert even better.
TrainSen	10000	 I just hope that I will have money to but the tickets then, cause now I don't.
TrainSen	10000	 jeje,     A few hours ago I was doing my physics homework, it's just really hard, when I was in high school I was the best kid on physics and now I just feel really bad when I don't understand!, never happened before, I don't know if is because I cannot concentrate or because it's just really hard or because I'm loosing my intelligence, I think of that all the time, I have this scholarship that is helping me a lot with my finances but if my gpa goes down 3.
TrainSen	10000	 0 , they will take it away and then I will really be in deep trouble.
TrainSen	10000	 I just saw a picture or one of the pictures I have of my girlfriend in my room and that reminded me that I have to ask her if her dad said yes! finally.
TrainSen	10000	 we have been going out for almost a year and she just turned 18 last saturday, I was a really nice night, the problem is that her father doesn't know about us yet, we are afraid we might not like our relationship and then all would fall down.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel guilty for making her disobey her dads rules but we love each other and finally I would be the happiest guy ever if I can make it trough this semester maintaining  a good gpa and if my girlfriends dad agrees on our relationship.
TrainSen	00100	Well here I am doing my first assignment for college.
TrainSen	00100	 I really like it so far.
TrainSen	00100	 I had some problems with my course schedule at first but it all seemed to fall into place.
TrainSen	00100	 My life is like that though everything seems to just work.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know if I am the only person that feels like this (I doubt it) but I feel like I will accomplish something big in my life or at least be happy with my life but I don't have a clue what it is that I will be doing.
TrainSen	00100	 My dad seems to get pissed whenever I tell him that I don't know what I want to do with my life but other adults think that it is a good thing.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that it is because they don't fund my bill.
TrainSen	00100	 My dorm room is freezing I am going home this weekend to get some sweats and such.
TrainSen	00100	 My girlfriend is in town to get her stitches looked at (she had surgery) I hope she is ok.
TrainSen	00100	 We have been going out for awhile now and I think I love her.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that I am 19 and don't know what love is but it just feels so right.
TrainSen	00100	 She is in her last year of college at SFA now so I will only get to see her once a month or so.
TrainSen	00100	 Everyone says to break-up but it is only one year then she (hopefully) will come to UT.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't understand the idea that breaking up is a good plan.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean maybe if I was one of those people that just love to be in love I would but it isn't that I miss the physical part (though I do) I miss her someone else won't replace that I want her not a body.
TrainSen	00100	 Now to bore you out of your minds, I am very interested in nutrition/bodybuilding.
TrainSen	00100	 I played football for 4 years and weighed in at a fat laden 290 lbs.
TrainSen	00100	 my sophomore year of high school but hey that is ok you play football.
TrainSen	00100	 well I quit due to many factors and guess what it isn't ok to just be fat.
TrainSen	00100	 I have worked my butt off literally.
TrainSen	00100	 I now am 200 lbs and have gained strength.
TrainSen	00100	 I estimate myself at 13% body fat but I want to do better and I know that I can.
TrainSen	00100	 I spend a lot of time researching various aspects of training and diets.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it may be dominating my life.
TrainSen	00100	 But it isn't a hobby it is a lifestyle.
TrainSen	00100	 But really who else eats every 2 hours? And for that matter what the heck do they eat on campus I have these cursed dine-in dollars but I can only eat about 3 things here everything is terrible for you! I am not exaggerating ok maybe I can eat 5 things but come on! Why do we not have fat-free cottage cheese? lean beef? real grilled chicken not the baby pieces I am paying for now.
TrainSen	00100	 Why is it always free pizza at 11 at night complex carb+late night=fat why no free tuna, or free vegetables? why is Gregory closed from 8-12:05?! So what if I am not in the friggin weight class I know how to lift better than they do let me in! I worked in a weight room for 2 years you think I can't be courteous and rack my weights or get out of others way let them work-in etc? come on want to fight the freshmen 15? get better food! we were ranked last in dorm food LAST Texas should never be last in anything except for people you wan to fight.
TrainSen	00100	 this is outrageous.
TrainSen	00100	 OK Now that I have ranted and let that out I want to know if there is anything I can do about it.
TrainSen	00100	 NO there isn't how many students would eat fat-free cottage cheese? or tuna straight from the can? not enough to get the food people to bring it in.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well survive this year and move off campus next year with my girlfriend and eat right and be happy! something just buzzed in my room.
TrainSen	00001	Crap, I was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something.
TrainSen	00001	 I really hope it didn't already submit because I don't want to screw up my credit for this paper.
TrainSen	00001	 Great, now I'm completely paranoid that I've managed to screw up something so simple.
TrainSen	00001	 I'll keep my fingers crossed.
TrainSen	00001	 I need all the help I can get to do well in this class.
TrainSen	00001	 Actually, I haven't worried about my grades in a long time.
TrainSen	00001	 When tests start, I'll panic.
TrainSen	00001	 It's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures.
TrainSen	00001	 I never get enough rest.
TrainSen	00001	 My schedule's all out of order.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm tired all day long.
TrainSen	00001	 I hear my TV and want to go watch it.
TrainSen	00001	 I always put stuff off and watch too much television.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a problem with procrastinating.
TrainSen	00001	 I never used to be this bad.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm scared that since I can't get on a study plan, I'll fail.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate it when I over use a word when I'm writing.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel like I haven't written enough, but does length matter?  My birthday is next week, which somewhat depresses me.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not close to any of my friends, and I'm scared they're going to forget about me.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel like the only loser out of my friends who's not having this great college experience.
TrainSen	00001	 It's not that I'm homesick, just kind of restless and bored.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't met that many people and frankly, feel like an outcast.
TrainSen	00001	 My head hurts, but I have no tylenol.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate swallowing pills.
TrainSen	00001	 I used to break them up and put them in yogurt.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm such a wuss.
TrainSen	00001	 My roommate went home for the afternoon.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm glad she is gone.
TrainSen	00001	 She can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness.
TrainSen	00001	 I went out of town one weekend, and she made my bed.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't really want her invading my space and touching my things.
TrainSen	00001	Stream of Consciousness? How do you start something so vague.
TrainSen	00001	 I keep a journal which I write in occasionally, but I can not remember the last time an assignment consisted solely of write your thoughts.
TrainSen	00001	 "" I'd be willing to bet that the beginning of most of these streams is a self consciousness, because that is definitely what I am feeling right now.
TrainSen	00001	 It's late Monday night and I am taking this time to break up the reading that I have fallen behind in.
TrainSen	00001	 While I am technically still studying psychology, it does provide a nice change of pace to the abysmal pages of text.
TrainSen	00001	 What is the point of this assignment anyway? How could one person possibly gather a conclusion from over 600 students listing off whatever pops into their mind? I guess the biggest amazement for me is how these psychologists are able to gather data from such an unreliable subject.
TrainSen	00001	 the human mind.
TrainSen	00001	 There really is no other single entity (besides the female mind) which is so complex and irregular.
TrainSen	00001	 Humans are an interesting study, which explains why so many students choose to take anthropology, sociology and history.
TrainSen	00001	 But psychology really is the king of the social sciences, it's all but required for a college student.
TrainSen	00001	 I couldn't believe how stereotypical I felt when I uttered the phrase ""my psych class"", it's the single most overheard expression on this campus outside of the greek alphabet.
TrainSen	00001	 Now that I mentioned the greek societies on our campus, I'd like to delve into that a little.
TrainSen	00001	 After overhearing a pack of sorority girls outside of Kinsolving today, (they travel in packs) their conversation only bolstered my opinion that Sororities and Fraternities actually limit social interaction.
TrainSen	00001	 Sure it's great to pile in kids to the parties and attempt to shack up with a sorority chick, but I honestly don't feel compelled to join a fraternity.
TrainSen	00001	 Free beer and life long friends may be something that is promised upon the rush season, but it seems to me that in exchange the member loses their individuality.
TrainSen	00001	 Fraternity issues become the mindset of the member, and any excuse to discuss those issues with another person, be they in the same frat or not, is almost always taken advantage of.
TrainSen	00001	 Yes, some fraternities do some good community work, but it limits people into one train of thought, their loyalty is admirable to the members, but to the outside they seem transparent and single minded.
TrainSen	00001	 Of course, coming from a freshman non-frat male, that sounds like every other person with an opinion, ready to lay waste to the organizations with his individuality.
TrainSen	00001	 I really don't oppose the fraternity/sorority concept, because it is a need some people truly need filled.
TrainSen	00001	 But the sight of another party where 70% of the attendance is male, 20% are lifeless girls not interested in meeting people, and the other 10% are passed out, it makes them all seem the same.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel that rant about fraternities could pass as given off by anybody, but not only did that illustrate my frustration with constantly hearing about the Kappa party or the Pi Phi foam bash, but helped me vent to something beyond my friends who also are constantly kicked out of those parties.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel definitely stereotypical again, from discussing my feelings toward psychology to my frustration with frat parties, could I possibly be the more prototypical male? Well, here's the sinker, it's time to discuss sports.
TrainSen	00001	 I cover them for a newspaper, but honestly I'm just like another fan, but willing to put in the work.
TrainSen	00001	 Too often the news pages are filled with guys who belong on the radio, it's like their verbal garbage should be filling empty air time instead of priceless page space.
TrainSen	00001	 Any fan with a computer can put together that the Cowboys are in a rebuilding year, but how many fans would be willing to go to the practices, meet the coaches and do the dirty work of actually uncovering the story.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I am frustrated with the lazy column writing which features another talking head giving his 'take' about the latest controversy regarding sports.
TrainSen	00001	 That's not to say that all of them are  garbage, but too many of them I find repetitive and dull, and bringing nothing new to the argument.
TrainSen	00001	 Covering a sport is different than giving an opinion, and I enjoy covering sports because of its complexity and difficulty of trying to shape a story out of thin air.
TrainSen	00001	 I love the hunt, and that not only makes me strange, but a pretty good fit for a newspaper writer.
TrainSen	00001	 Of course, as a college freshman, I really don't have an inkling of an idea on what is my true calling, but I figure the experience couldn't hurt.
TrainSen	00001	 Much like my decision to take this psychology class, it may seem stereotypical, but the experience and exposure to a new understanding of the human brain could not hurt my chances on a better understanding of myself and others.
TrainSen	00001	 My time is up, I am sorry to whoever is reading this, it must seem very much like the others I'm sure, but I look forward to this class and I thank you for this very interesting assignment.
TrainSen	00010	So here goes.
TrainSen	00010	 I am really starting to stress out about all this college stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 It seems like my to-do list just keeps getting longer and the time I have to complete everything just keeps shrinking.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope and pray that as time goes by I will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life.
TrainSen	00010	 It has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work.
TrainSen	00010	 But as my brother once told me, you must work hard in order to play hard.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly, and keep thinking positive about my situation.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm hoping that I can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come.
TrainSen	00010	 Well enough about that.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm really starting to miss my family a lot.
TrainSen	00010	 I think that is really lame but I can't help it really.
TrainSen	00010	 Like I love Austin and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of Sunnyvale, Texas that I miss incredibly.
TrainSen	00010	 I went home last weekend and had a blast reuniting with all my old friends.
TrainSen	00010	 Gosh I love my friends here but its just not the same.
TrainSen	00010	 There is just something about the familiar that keeps me constantly wanting to latch on to it and never leave.
TrainSen	00010	 But I know that that is impossible for someone like me who constantly strives to better myself and achieve my goals.
TrainSen	00010	 And UT is the place to do it.
TrainSen	00010	 I love this place! The people sometimes freak me out but its nice to be exposed to strange people for a change.
TrainSen	00010	 I am so excited about this weekend! One of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and I keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend! Gosh you know what.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 15"" theory! Because I sure do eat a lot these days.
TrainSen	00010	 The food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist! Its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you.
TrainSen	00010	 No here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it! Its great! Its amazing to me how different college life is from high school.
TrainSen	00010	 Like in high school everyone cared about everyone else's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here.
TrainSen	00010	 No one cares about anyone else's business at all.
TrainSen	00010	 people are just concerned with themselves.
TrainSen	00010	 And another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules! Like you can do whatever the heck you want and NO ONE will tell you that you are wrong or that you can't do something.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking, you can! I laugh every time I see people doing that in my classes.
TrainSen	00010	 I would never be able to make myself do that because I'm too much of a chicken but I think its so funny! Gosh.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm really starting to get hungry again.
TrainSen	00010	 that is so bad! NO! I can't eat again! I am really not looking forward to going to class again at 7pm.
TrainSen	00010	 that is really late and I'm extremely tired! I really hope that I can find a date to Anchors Away.
TrainSen	00010	 that is really bugging me.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I knew exactly who I wanted to take and who wanted to go so that I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore! Alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so I'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me.
TrainSen	00010	 haha! This was good.
TrainSen	00010	 its kind of a way to let your problems go all at once.
TrainSen	00010	 I actually feel better to get all this out and see my thoughts on paper.
TrainSen	00010	 Not to mention that I feel better knowing that this writing assignment is out of my hair so that is one less thing I have to worry and stress out about.
TrainSen	00001	Sorry for any grammar mistakes in this timed writing.
TrainSen	00001	 There's a bit of pressure writing every thought you have within 20 minutes and try and make it completely coherent.
TrainSen	00001	 The music in the back ground plays that of falling falling falling.
TrainSen	00001	 Then hits a note as if the journey of which it began will continue.
TrainSen	00001	 Adversaries in between as if rapids in the path.
TrainSen	00001	 The sun glares in as it goes lower in the sky.
TrainSen	00001	 Now at this hour of the day is when my apartment is the warmest.
TrainSen	00001	 The light carries in like the rays dance and shuffle past the leaves of the tree outside.
TrainSen	00001	 I watch my friends sit next to me.
TrainSen	00001	 One is a zombie slasher with a chain saw for an arm, the other sits and types quietly.
TrainSen	00001	 The music is quieter now with bell like rings in it.
TrainSen	00001	 The bass has a slow but progressive sound to it.
TrainSen	00001	 The guitar sings about as the music moves on.
TrainSen	00001	 Over the middle window, the one with the blinds shut, we keep the blue mask.
TrainSen	00001	 It has sharp looking teeth which are yellow.
TrainSen	00001	 The teeth match the horns.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm now half past the time of when I started.
TrainSen	00001	 Some pauses have been taken in between sentences or paragraphs.
TrainSen	00001	 Sorry for the time of which I slacked.
TrainSen	00001	 I loosing ideas of what to write now.
TrainSen	00001	 I have little more to to tell of my surroundings more.
TrainSen	00001	 The music is now more of a popping sounds.
TrainSen	00001	 It also mud     like sounding guitar now.
TrainSen	00001	 My phone is ringing now but I got my friend to pick it up.
TrainSen	00001	 I will call them back.
TrainSen	00001	 This is now the end.
TrainSen	00100	My roommate just had a sandwich from subway, and the smell is killing me.
TrainSen	00100	 It's one of my favorite things to eat.
TrainSen	00100	 He gets somewhat annoying, though.
TrainSen	00100	 Right now he is playing a video game, and he is got the volume turned way up.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't mind so much; it's just hard to get my thoughts straight.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate the way milk leaves a sour taste in your mouth.
TrainSen	00100	 I always end up having to chew some gum or brush my teeth again, but it is so good.
TrainSen	00100	 Everything I am saying sounds really stupid.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess that's how the mind works though.
TrainSen	00100	 I've never actually had to plot out my exact thoughts.
TrainSen	00100	 Most of them just kind of run through my head, with the important ones being the only truly pondered thoughts.
TrainSen	00100	 He (my roommate) keeps talking to his game.
TrainSen	00100	 It's getting old.
TrainSen	00100	 The game is cool though; a bit violent but very addictive.
TrainSen	00100	 It even gets a little scary at night some of the time.
TrainSen	00100	 Nights are so weird here.
TrainSen	00100	 It always feels a lot later than it is, or not late enough.
TrainSen	00100	 I always end up forgetting to call home and my girlfriend because by the time I remember it's too late to be calling the east coast.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know where my relationship with her is going.
TrainSen	00100	 We've been dating for almost four years.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I should tell my roommate that the talking gets annoying.
TrainSen	00100	 Would that offend him though?  I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know about a lot of things.
TrainSen	00100	 And I just realized that I just used the word don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 ""  The internet lingo is getting out of hand.
TrainSen	00100	 I used to be online almost all day long.
TrainSen	00100	 He is still talking.
TrainSen	00100	 At least I can look forward to the game this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 For once I won't mind the noise.
TrainSen	00100	 It's kind of exciting.
TrainSen	00100	 My first Texas game.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so bored.
TrainSen	00100	 I really need to meet people.
TrainSen	00100	 Being from out-of-state definitely has its downside.
TrainSen	00100	 Everyone seems to know everybody here and that doesn't help me very much.
TrainSen	00100	 It seems a little awkward to walk up to someone and introduce myself, but that's what I have to do or I'll be spending a lot of time in my dorm room.
TrainSen	00100	 That, my friend, was a run off sentence, but I'm much too lazy to correct it right now.
TrainSen	00100	 Stayed up too late last night because I don't have any classes today.
TrainSen	00100	 I should really finish my homework after this, but I am way too lazy for that.
TrainSen	00100	 There it goes.
TrainSen	00100	 My roommate made me lose where I was going with that last thought.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm kind of thirsty right now, I should get a bottle of water.
TrainSen	00100	 The Austin water is gross.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm definitely not feeling the fact that there are no agents in the water to clean it.
TrainSen	00100	 We've been buying water left and right.
TrainSen	00100	 We should really get a Brita filter.
TrainSen	00100	 This game really is addicting.
TrainSen	00100	 I just lost all train of thought watching it for a matter of 30 seconds.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't think that it's a good thing to do that.
TrainSen	00100	 This whole writing is filled with vague pronoun references.
TrainSen	00100	 My 11th grade english (is that supposed to be capitalized) would murder me if she knew I was writing like this, but I suppose it is okay as long as I don't get into the habit of writing this way.
TrainSen	00100	 I am really slack.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm only taking 13 hours this semester and I still don't do any homework.
TrainSen	00100	 At least I am doing okay on my graded assignments.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00100	 This is college life and for once I'm not going to have my mom around to push me to study and do my work.
TrainSen	00100	 The timer seems like it is moving a lot slower now than before.
TrainSen	00100	 Just like when I'm running; it always takes so much longer for 20 minutes to pass when I'm on one the treadmill.
TrainSen	00100	 Very dull, indeed.
TrainSen	01000	Today I went to class at 8AM.
TrainSen	01000	 I didn't want to get up at all.
TrainSen	01000	 Even though I slept by 11PM, it was really hard to wake up this morning.
TrainSen	01000	 I do not look forward towards Tuesdays and Thursdays.
TrainSen	01000	 My first class today at 8AM was all the way across campus and it made the walk there more dreadful.
TrainSen	01000	 Also, when I got up there I didn't learn a bit.
TrainSen	01000	 You know how in Charlie Brown the teacher talks like wah wah wahhh wah wah.
TrainSen	01000	 "", the teacher's aid voice just seemed to trail away.
TrainSen	01000	 As the class neared the end, I left early so that I could go home and catch a couple of z's before my next class which was at 11AM.
TrainSen	01000	 Soon as I got home, I just fell asleep almost instantaneously.
TrainSen	01000	 For some odd reason, I had a dream of home.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe I do miss it more than I think.
TrainSen	01000	 By 10:30AM, I woke up to get myself prepared for the next class.
TrainSen	01000	 I left late and arrived to class late, leaving me to sitting on the floor next to the door.
TrainSen	01000	 Taking notes is such a pain in the ass, when trying to use your legs as a desk.
TrainSen	01000	 I just sat there thinking about the repetitive information.
TrainSen	01000	 Then soon after the 2nd or 3rd example, I blanked out and started to think about what I should do when I get home (back to my dorm) and that I needed to study for a quiz the next class.
TrainSen	01000	 After the very monotonous class was over, I head towards my dorm room to eat some lunch with my roommate.
TrainSen	01000	 I think he is feeling the same way as I do, tired, hungry, nostalgic, and lethargic.
TrainSen	01000	 After lunch, I got prepared for my quiz.
TrainSen	01000	 I ended up studying for 10 minutes at most.
TrainSen	01000	 I should have studied more but I wasn't up to it.
TrainSen	01000	 After studying a little, I watched the news and then headed for a class.
TrainSen	01000	 I also went to that class a little late.
TrainSen	01000	 For some reason, today has just been an ""off"" day.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I did rather well on that quiz and the information didn't seem like it was ""out of this world.
TrainSen	01000	 ""                 I guess the best way to track my feelings/ thoughts for this 20 minutes is the way I felt and thought about my day.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like this day was pointless in some way and that I should have done something productive.
TrainSen	01000	 It seems like I always feel like that.
TrainSen	01000	 The only thing I've achieved today was canceling my friend's plane ticket from Northwest Arkansas to Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 She was coming to watch the old rivals play.
TrainSen	01000	 I cancelled the airplane ticket because she found a cheaper mode of transportation.
TrainSen	01000	 Other than that I set up my new computer and caught up with the news in Iraq and in California and also the hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I need to be motivated more.
TrainSen	01000	 Someone to tell me that I need to go do something or someone to go do something with.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess it's because I am feeling nostalgia.
TrainSen	01000	 Back at home, I usually had someone to go do something with me or ask me to do something or whatever.
TrainSen	01000	 But in this new setting and the freedom, I haven't done too much.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe I am doing more than the usual because I've finished most of my homework and chores this weekend and I'm just thinking that I need to do more.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess it'll take me a while to get use to the college life.
TrainSen	00001	ben stiller and his movies crack me up I wish I was up stairs watching it right now and not writing for 20 minutes on what is on my mind but maybe this way I will tap into my subconscious or something my girlfriend is not answering her phone but she always does I wonder what she is doing.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm happy that I'm going to dallas to see her but last night she was making me mad by hanging around other guys and at all these parties.
TrainSen	00001	 I like ut but I think I would have a much better time at smu with her, not only would I be with her a lot more but I like the school better and its not so overwhelming and is a lot smaller.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel bad for lying to her the other night about having our neighbors, some girls over, but whatever I mean she goes over to guys apts to hang out and I mean since I'm the dominant male figure I guess that inviting girls over means that you like them or something.
TrainSen	00001	 whatever it just does not register right, I mean like its cool for her to go to a guys apt, but its not for me to have chicks over, like that is not fair and Its not like I like any of these girls its just that I want to be social and have girls as friends just as much as she does.
TrainSen	00001	 you know its weird that I have these feelings but I almost feel like I could spend the rest of my life with her.
TrainSen	00001	 she is fun witty sexy as hell blonde rich great person in her heart and I think everything that a guy would want, although she has great things about her there is also some downsides.
TrainSen	00001	 like in party situations I always find her wondering off and talking to her friends and when I come up to her she acts almost as if she does not know me.
TrainSen	00001	 is she ashamed? I don't think so but it could seem that way to others.
TrainSen	00001	 but maybe its because I do it to, I mean when I'm at a party I like to be with my friends to so I guess were both guilty.
TrainSen	00001	 damn that movie meet the parents is funny and I want to go watch it badly and I have only typed for 10 min, o well halfway done.
TrainSen	00001	 so its like the glass is half full not half empty because I am a positive, optimist.
TrainSen	00001	 I like the new book jarrett gave me.
TrainSen	00001	 sometimes I'm just real un positve about things and a book on being positive can help me out in life and with school.
TrainSen	00001	 this interview or presentation I went to last night for this sales company was pretty cool I think I could potentially make some money doing it but as I sat there and listened to this over-energetic guy talk about oh yea you can make all this money and blah blah blah I thought to myself this is just one of those get rich quick schemes because at the end of this thing you pay 50 for a application and some of there products, what company just lets you sit through a presentation and BAM you got the job.
TrainSen	00001	 jarrest going to do it so I think since he has been successful in his endeavors with business and sales I think hey why not give it a try what is the worst that can happen.
TrainSen	00001	 Bud sounds good right now although I have not smoked in a while I wonder why, I guess its cause I act different when I'm stoned and maybe I don't like it, I like to get high after I workout cause for some reason it feels good and makes me feel as if I'm not just a lazy pothead, is pennebaker going to care that I'm talking about this? o well that is what is on my mind so take it or leave it jk.
TrainSen	00001	 yea I'm almost done with this , I thought this was going to be a formal paper with research and stuff but what a badass assignment, I think I'm going to like this teacher unlike my eco teacher Wolitz I can't stand her ugly face and bad teaching I just don't like her you know just one of those ppl.
TrainSen	00001	 I bombed her test today to because she is boring and does not make the class want to learn anything.
TrainSen	10000	As I'm sitting here at my computer I'm thinking about how bad I started off this semester.
TrainSen	10000	 I know that I should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier.
TrainSen	10000	 Plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule.
TrainSen	10000	 Causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking, but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm also thinking how tired I am from staying up all night studying.
TrainSen	10000	 In the back of my mind I'm hoping to get this work study job so that I can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school, considering how I took 12 hours and worked this summer.
TrainSen	10000	 I keep smelling my cologne (CK1) that I accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning.
TrainSen	10000	 A lot more came out then I expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else.
TrainSen	10000	 Had I not been so tired maybe I would have realized that I only needed a couple of drops.
TrainSen	10000	 Not to mention everywhere I have went today people either say, someone put on to much cologne, or , you smell good.
TrainSen	10000	 I 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner.
TrainSen	10000	 My brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work I need to do.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm homesick already.
TrainSen	10000	 I miss my family and I have only been here a couple of weeks.
TrainSen	10000	 I didn't expect this my sophomore year.
TrainSen	10000	 I thought it only happened to freshmen.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel really hungry too.
TrainSen	10000	 I haven't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at Gregory.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team.
TrainSen	10000	 But with my luck they won't have tryouts for the second year in a row.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as I did.
TrainSen	10000	 Probably not because they all play sports.
TrainSen	10000	 I think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you don't you won't play.
TrainSen	10000	 I think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes.
TrainSen	10000	 they think they have it easy and that they get free grades.
TrainSen	10000	 They don't.
TrainSen	10000	 They have a job.
TrainSen	10000	 there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired.
TrainSen	10000	 While fighting through the daily soreness and injuries, they have to try to get school work done.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that is tough.
TrainSen	10000	 I have sympathy for them.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope that I can get everything done today that needs to be done and also I plan on changing my shirt before this CK1 gives me a headache.
TrainSen	10000	 I probably will never wear CK1 again.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope all my friends and family are doing well.
TrainSen	10000	 I plan to get some good sleep tonight also, of course after all my work is done.
TrainSen	10000	 time is running out so bye.
TrainSen	10000	I am so hungry.
TrainSen	10000	 I Can't wait until lunch in 40 minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm going with my twin sister and our new friend Kristin.
TrainSen	10000	 she is my sorority sister.
TrainSen	10000	 I love being in a sorority.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm kinda nervous though, I hope I make a lot of friends.
TrainSen	10000	 I hate this song that is playing, its so annoying.
TrainSen	10000	 I really want to change the station.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't wait, I want some pretzel and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
TrainSen	10000	 and some fruit, definitely a banana.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm worried that the peanut butter is going to make me fat.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm not used to the food here, even thought I don't really look fat, I feel a little fatter, but I'm not eating bad junk food, just normal food, but its not like the food from home.
TrainSen	10000	 plus I'm not getting as much exercise here, its just so hard to fit everything in, and I'm not in a schedule yet, I hate that.
TrainSen	10000	 but I really want to be more easy going.
TrainSen	10000	 school I scaring me right now, I'm worried because we have not had any tests yet so I don't really know what any of them are going to be like, so I don't know how I will do, and I'm not at all used to doing bad, I always get high a's and I don't know if that will happen here.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope a good song comes on now that one finally ended! so anyways I'm really really freaked out because my hair is falling out.
TrainSen	10000	 like I sit here and .
TrainSen	10000	 wait I love this song! I want to turn it up.
TrainSen	10000	 anyways I think its because of all the stress I'm under.
TrainSen	10000	 this happened to me earlier this summer and then I winced I finally relaxed it stopped, but its like a chain reaction because I get stressed and worried so my hair falls out and then once I see my hair falling out I get even more stressed and worried because it always looks so bad in a pony tail and when its down it just never looks good any more and it makes me feel ugly so that stress me out more and I continue to worry and it just does not stop.
TrainSen	10000	 last week was really hard but this week I think I'm more used to everything so hopefully I will stop stressing so much because its not really doing me any good, I just want to have so much fun at college and I totally am.
TrainSen	10000	 I really like all the friends I have made so far.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a really fun group of girls in my dorm we call ourselves kin's klan lol.
TrainSen	10000	 we all live at kinsolving, I m so happy that we are friends and that we have so much fun together.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't wait to start making some good guy friends.
TrainSen	10000	 it sucks because they are always so drunk whenever I meet them so they never remember my name even though we've met like 20 times but that happens to everyone.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm not really hungry anymore but I just want to go to lunch and see my friends.
TrainSen	10000	 o crap I have to go to stupid calculus after that and I really don't want to go and watch my t/a get chalk dust all over himself he is such a mess and I can't understand him at all I hope I am able to figure out the last five problems today so that I don't have to do it anymore and I can just submit the answers and get one thing done.
TrainSen	10000	 o yah I have to ask eklly about chemistry I hope she remembers how to convert celcius to ferenhright and how to calculate water displacement because I definitely don't remember.
TrainSen	10000	 ooo my fingers are tired.
TrainSen	10000	 but I like typing lol.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm really enjoying reading all this psychology stuff its fun but at the same time I'm totally self diagnosing myself.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm like oo my neurotransmitters are so messed up and I need drugs for these and I need drugs for these I think its kinda funny at the same time.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't wait until our mixer tomorrow night with sae it is going to be awesome.
TrainSen	10000	 and then the match on friedya I really want to dress up whitetrash but that will be weird wehn we go to ato which we willdef do because I'm a totally ato groupie and I'm still dressed in my white trash outfit.
TrainSen	10000	 the music is out how annoying it must not have good reception.
TrainSen	10000	 I never listen to music here anymore and I barely watch tv I kinda like that there is just too much other stuff to do and if there is time to relax then there is time to do homework which I always haved or time to hang out wiht kins klan or time to sleep.
TrainSen	10000	 I really need more sleep I just took a 20minute nap in between my two last classes it was great I love feeling so refreshed I felt like I slept for hours.
TrainSen	10000	 why can't I feel that good in the morning? ewww that morning that makes me think of the disgusting yogurt they had in the cafeteria, first it was not mixed.
TrainSen	10000	 like I could see gross water in it so I mixed it and then it was plain,.
TrainSen	10000	 who serves plain yogurt.
TrainSen	10000	 op I'm hungry again.
TrainSen	10000	 and know I have to go to the bathroom.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I get used to community bath soon because its so weird like just uncomfortable I don't want to listen to other girls going to the restroom lol.
TrainSen	10000	 o well I'm sure ill get over it its only the 3rd week but it feels like I have been here forever I love it so much freedom and I can do anything I want it will be so weird going home next summer.
TrainSen	10000	 next summer we already have to be renting apartments for next year its way to early I have only lived here for 3 weeks I hope I get good roommates and live in a fun complex like either the new new villas or the new boardwalk that would be crazy fun,, maybe a little too much fun lol I hope I'd be able to get my work done o well I can't wait to have so much fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I really think I would be nice to meet a cute /nice guy here.
TrainSen	00001	The start of this semester has been again full of stress and anxiety.
TrainSen	00001	 I wake up everyday depressed and knowing that the day will only bring about more problems.
TrainSen	00001	 It is a bit pessimistic of me but this is what I am used to.
TrainSen	00001	 For instance, right now I can feel my head throbbing because of my headache.
TrainSen	00001	 The only reason I have it in the first place is because of school.
TrainSen	00001	 The hardships of being a pre-med student have already taken a toll on me and sometimes I think I'm not strong enough to continue.
TrainSen	00001	 The only think that keeps me going is the thought of one day making my parents proud.
TrainSen	00001	 Yet, this means that I have to do extremely well in all of my classes and for the past year I have done far from that.
TrainSen	00001	 I constantly worry about my GPA and not getting into medical school and it gets to a point where I tune out everything else.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm even thinking about my chances at medical school right now typing this diary"".
TrainSen	00001	 This is the sad truth about me and I try to cope with it.
TrainSen	00001	 I remember in the summer I had lost all care of school and GPA and I was finally happy and in a world of peace.
TrainSen	00001	 I had thought that my return back to school would be much for more exciting because I had stopped worrying about this whole pre-med issue.
TrainSen	00001	 Sadly, I'm here again thinking about it non-stop.
TrainSen	00001	 Its almost like I go to school to impress my family rather than trying to have a fun filled 4 years.
TrainSen	00001	 Why is it so difficult to become a doctor if you know that its what you want to do? Why do I have to compete with my peers for the few spots open in medical schools? Sometimes these questions drive me nuts.
TrainSen	00001	 I try my best to distract myself from it.
TrainSen	00001	 Like right now I'm listening to the rain hit my window.
TrainSen	00001	 The sound of it crashing my window is so soothing and peaceful and I wish I was just outside splashing around.
TrainSen	00001	 My life has turned into this academic challenge and I hardly have time for myself and my needs.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess that's why I join organizations.
TrainSen	00001	 Then again, they make matters only worse when they share with me how wonderful their GPAs are.
TrainSen	00001	 I would do freshmen year all over again in a heartbeat if someone ever gave me the chance.
TrainSen	00001	 I regret the recklessness I showed toward my work, thinking it was all going to be a piece of cake like high school.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe that is why I make my brother study so much.
TrainSen	00001	 I never want him to make the mistakes I made yet am I ruining his own social life by doing this? I believe I don't.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that in the end he will be thankful because he won't have to worry about taking 17 hours very semester just to raise his GPA so that schools will think of him as ""competitive"".
TrainSen	00001	 I wish sometimes I had had a guide.
TrainSen	00001	 My roommate from last year was a business major and all he did was read a textbook for 10 minutes and then watch TV and I would undoubtedly get dragged in.
TrainSen	00001	 It makes me so angry to think that I was so immature and nonchalant.
TrainSen	00001	 On a side note, I've never ranted so much before especially on the computer.
TrainSen	00001	 It's kinda helping me to take off mental burden that I carry.
TrainSen	00001	 However, staring at this bright monitor is only increasing my headache.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways, I basically just frustrate myself over this whole medical school dilemma.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I could just go into the future and not have to worry about this anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 The day I get the acceptance letter (or rejection letter) will be the happiest day of my life.
TrainSen	00001	 I'll probably try again the next year but it won't matter to me as much anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't really know how to explain it but that same anxiety that goes with ""first times"" won't be there anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 I've considered many majors and have really thought about doing something else with my life but somehow I'm always dragged back into medicine.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe its the challenge that I like even though at times I would gladly give it up.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I worry so much about my future because I really want to see myself become a doctor.
TrainSen	00001	 This is truly my passion and I'll never give up on it no matter how hard it gets at times.
TrainSen	00001	 I just hope I'm not the only one going through this hysteria because it would really make me look like a psychopath after this.
TrainSen	00001	 Even so, something tells me that I'm not alone out there and sometimes that just brightens up my day even if it's for a short while.
TrainSen	00001	hmmm.
TrainSen	00001	 at 18, my life thus far has been where I want it.
TrainSen	00001	 The USMC has given me the newfound sense of self one craves after a monotonous high school career.
TrainSen	00001	 Football, basketball, summer activities, UIL academic meets, clubs, and band, they say, will be the things you cherish for the rest of your life.
TrainSen	00001	 Memories.
TrainSen	00001	 They will be the best years of your life say those who never went to college.
TrainSen	00001	 The next 4 will be your best years of your life.
TrainSen	00001	 "" say those who have.
TrainSen	00001	 But will they be? The Crucible was more difficult than anything I could ever imagine attempting, but I made it.
TrainSen	00001	 Lying in a pit covered in barbed wire and mud and feeling the wildest sense of dread, failure, hatred, anger for being awake for 3 days with only 2 MRE's to last the entire ordeal.
TrainSen	00001	 Feeling that the sun would never set.
TrainSen	00001	 Being away from my family and everything that I loved for a quarter of a year with no means of contact besides staying up after lights out, sitting on a stone cold toilet in the head because it was the only source of light by which to write.
TrainSen	00001	 Knowing that you're giving up the sleep, the rest, that will carry you through the next day.
TrainSen	00001	 Hate towards the others in the platoon for their Goddamn stupidity, hard-headed, fight without listening to reason, their never-ending bitching and trying to hold an edge over everyone else.
TrainSen	00001	 It's a real life world of shit.
TrainSen	00001	 Brings to mind that show on MTV called ""Oz"", haven't seen but advertisements for it.
TrainSen	00001	 Prisoners talking about ""the hard life"" of prison.
TrainSen	00001	 What do they have that I didn't have at MCRD San Diego.
TrainSen	00001	 Prison vs.
TrainSen	00001	 Boot Camp.
TrainSen	00001	 They have TV, books, newspapers, double ply toilet paper, free time, phone calls, a weight room, good food, the right to lay on the rack whenever they wish, the right to sit down, cigarettes, the ability to do whatever the hell they want.
TrainSen	00001	 What did I have? Not a single one of those things.
TrainSen	00001	 A month in the desert, worrying that one of North America's pit vipers or coral snakes would find its way into my sleeping bag as I slept on a rocky desert floor, or the guy next to you on the firing line would trip and put a 5.
TrainSen	00001	 56mm round into your back, or falling while hiking without light on a steep slope in the middle of a moonless night with 80 pounds of gear and splitting my grape on a rock.
TrainSen	00001	 Days go by slow when you're having a bad day at the office or in the classroom.
TrainSen	00001	 Time is suspended when you're so miserable that you would almost rather die than continue through the rest of training It was a different sort of feeling felt in life.
TrainSen	00001	 Hadn't had if before.
TrainSen	00001	 but I miss it.
TrainSen	00001	 I'd never felt so alive.
TrainSen	00001	 What we take for granted in life: friends, our favorite book, the faithful German Shepherd, a home cooked meal, a grassy lawn, a drive down a country road that reminds you of your childhood.
TrainSen	00001	 those are given new meaning.
TrainSen	00001	 The feeling of infinite pride, accomplishment, belonging, knowing that you live your life not for the boss, not for others, not for money, not for possession, and knowing that you cannot be defeated.
TrainSen	00001	 I felt that during Marine Corps graduation.
TrainSen	00001	 That is what I will remember and cherish in life.
TrainSen	00001	 Throwing the ""greatest party"", making $100 grand a year vs $40, driving an Aston Martin.
TrainSen	00001	 What does that crap mean if you don't truly own yourself? Like those who fawn over celebrities or drive expensive cars that their ego thrives on but their families at home cannot afford.
TrainSen	00001	 They will never know the meaning of life.
TrainSen	00001	 I know that I may never be the investment banker that all college kids know they will be, but I will have a rich life.
TrainSen	00001	 I will not be the movie star that everyone knows they will be, but I know that I will be loved by those who matter to me.
TrainSen	00001	 I look forward to the future.
TrainSen	00100	My name is jon krebbs and I forgot my code I'm really sorry my roommate wants to know what this paper is about I answered ""stream of conscious no I'm thinking you dumbass and damn that tool in the background sounds awesome.

TrainSen	00100	clear waters beckening - wow - this is not going to work - my mind is blank - or is it.
TrainSen	00100	 - is it just blank because I have to write down what is going threw it.
TrainSen	00100	 hmmmm its 20* degrees celcius right now.
TrainSen	00100	 that does not even really matter, I prob.
TrainSen	00100	 won't go outside unless I need to smoke a cigarette or something.
TrainSen	00100	 spike tv.
TrainSen	00100	 what kinda dumb sh** is this.
TrainSen	00100	 this show sucks - why are they trying to advertise this show with some crazy exciting name like spike tv"" - 20 minutes is a long time to be typing.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if it matters how crude my thoughts are.
TrainSen	00100	 better keep tha inappropriate thoughts out.
TrainSen	00100	 is that possible.
TrainSen	00100	 yeah.
TrainSen	00100	 school takes up a lot of time - and I don't know if getting a degree will even matter, so what is the point.
TrainSen	00100	 I should just stop typing right now, pack a bag, get in my car, and drive to mexico.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder what the point of that survey earlier was.
TrainSen	00100	 where do all these ""personal type surveys"" going.
TrainSen	00100	 is some little guy sitting behind a desk compiling information about me based on the questions I filled out about once a year since I was old enough to go to publicly funded schools.
TrainSen	00100	 if there really is a guy that is comparing all my information right now - I wonder how much someone in that position would get paid.
TrainSen	00100	 hahah - getting paid to make assumptions about a person out of a bunch of personal questions.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that job would be pretty boring.
TrainSen	00100	 I would have to get intoxicated or something before going to work everyday, that tedious paper work would drive me crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 that is prob.
TrainSen	00100	 why people go all postal and shoot people at work - cause they have to do tedious crap everyday that has no bearing.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope nothing pushes me over the edge of insanity.
TrainSen	00100	 that would suck.
TrainSen	00100	 it might not be bad though - I imagine the government would provide a pretty comfortable living for someone who was ""mentally handicapped"".
TrainSen	00100	 I bet a few people have thought they were insane and really been on the same wave as everybody else.
TrainSen	00100	 its crazy to be alive and conscious.
TrainSen	00100	 consciousness gets dull - nothing modern intoxicants can't handle though, in moderation.
TrainSen	00100	 joe millionarie was a gay show I resent that guy.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I'm going to go smoke a cigarette.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't really think of what to say.
TrainSen	00100	 I need a cigarette to calm me down.
TrainSen	00100	 that is not even how you spell ""cigarette"" but spelling is not even that important.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean - its like this - professors and anyone else in my life has ragged on me about spelling and grammar.
TrainSen	00100	 but they know - and I know - that they knew what the meaning of the word I misspelled.
TrainSen	00100	 that kinda shit pisses me off.
TrainSen	00100	 need a smoke.
TrainSen	01000	ok, I'm really stressed out right now! I've been running around all day, then I got back to my friend's dorm and remembered that I had to do this writing assignment! Of course, stupid me.
TrainSen	01000	 I didn't know the web address to get here.
TrainSen	01000	 I had to call my roommate and have her look up the address on my computer.
TrainSen	01000	 and now its almost 5pm! GREAT.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, anyway, I'm so happy about last night.
TrainSen	01000	 This really hot guy that I like invited me over last night to hang out at his apartment :) Exciting! It was a lot of fun.
TrainSen	01000	 Now I can't stop thinking about him! I also can't stop thinking about Ryan.
TrainSen	01000	 He still won't talk to me because of that stupid bitch he is dating.
TrainSen	01000	 I HATE HER.
TrainSen	01000	 She got between me and Ryan's relationship, firstly, and then our friendship as well.
TrainSen	01000	 It's only been 4 minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't think right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm so anxious for this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, back to Ryan.
TrainSen	01000	 every night for the past couple weeks, I've had dreams about him.
TrainSen	01000	 They won't stop, it's getting annoying.
TrainSen	01000	 Even last night I had a dream that we ran into each other in Houston and were immediately friends again.
TrainSen	01000	 That's what I wish would happen.
TrainSen	01000	 He looked so cute in the dream.
TrainSen	01000	 so I wake up thinking about the stupid asshole.
TrainSen	01000	 BUT, at least this morning I woke up next to a hot guy :) :) That makes things a lot easier on me.
TrainSen	01000	 the only way I know how to get over a guy is by dating a new one.
TrainSen	01000	 I need distractions, GOOD distractions, to keep my mind off of Ryan.
TrainSen	01000	 It sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss him so much but I know he probably doesn't give a shit about me.
TrainSen	01000	 SO, I just want to feel.
TrainSen	01000	 wanted.
TrainSen	01000	 And if it's by this guy, Jason, that would be PERFECT.
TrainSen	01000	 He is awesome- cute, cool apartment, easy to get along with, funny, and he is even in the business school at UT! Pretty impressive.
TrainSen	01000	 Of course, with my luck, I'm sure he has plenty of girls after him- so why would he choose to be with me.
TrainSen	01000	 Hmmm well I can pray that he does! At least he wanted to be with me last night, that's a plus.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to think about something else! It's driving me crazy.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to go hang out with Laura soon.
TrainSen	01000	 she will make me talk about something besides guys! Yummm can't wait to order those delicious cookies from Tiffany's Treats! 13 minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 ALrighty then.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I have about a million thoughts running through my head right now and I can't seem to distinguish any certain thought.
TrainSen	01000	 Does that make sense? Ehh, oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 School is a stressful place, especially now.
TrainSen	01000	 What we do now creates what we can do for the rest of our lives! I don't want to fail.
TrainSen	01000	 yet I'm actually scared that I might.
TrainSen	01000	 I've never been scared of failing a class- ever.
TrainSen	01000	 I never made below a B on my report card in high school.
TrainSen	01000	 College is SO incredibly different! I really do love it here.
TrainSen	01000	 Even though the classes are challenging, UT is awesome.
TrainSen	01000	 I like having a big campus.
TrainSen	01000	 it makes it feel like college.
TrainSen	01000	 It's the way it should be.
TrainSen	01000	 At least I have a little workout every day- walking to class and up & down all those stairs all the time.
TrainSen	01000	 Its tiring! OK, 2 minutes left.
TrainSen	01000	 JC is distracting me.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to stop typing now! I'm sure whatever I just wrote down is somewhat interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't even remember what I said.
TrainSen	01000	 What should I do tonight.
TrainSen	01000	 hmmm everyone is going to the game tomorrow.
TrainSen	01000	 My dumbass didn't get the sports package so I can't go :( How sad.
TrainSen	00010	I am pretty tired today.
TrainSen	00010	 I haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks.
TrainSen	00010	 I have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier.
TrainSen	00010	 I work with the youth group at the church I go to.
TrainSen	00010	 It is getting very busy there as well.
TrainSen	00010	 We are really trying to get the numbers back up.
TrainSen	00010	 After the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little.
TrainSen	00010	 Right now I am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying.
TrainSen	00010	 I was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home.
TrainSen	00010	 We are working construction on our new church building.
TrainSen	00010	 It is very exciting.
TrainSen	00010	 We have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls.
TrainSen	00010	 So for the last week they have been breaking through walls.
TrainSen	00010	 It has been really cool to watch.
TrainSen	00010	 My coffee smells really good.
TrainSen	00010	 I am listening to some Audio Adrenaline.
TrainSen	00010	 They are a Christian band I just downloaded.
TrainSen	00010	 They sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though.
TrainSen	00010	 I am switching majors this semester from Engineering to a dual major in History and Spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh?  I think it will be good.
TrainSen	00010	 I got accepted into the UTeach program and so starting this semester I will be in an Austin public school teaching and observing.
TrainSen	00010	 I will be in the classroom starting next week.
TrainSen	00010	 I am very excited.
TrainSen	00010	 My arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 I think they are going to fall off.
TrainSen	00010	 I have a lot to do today.
TrainSen	00010	 Since I am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I will be pretty far behind in this class PSY 301 because the Co-OP does not have the book(it is out of stock) They won't have it until Monday the 8th.
TrainSen	00010	 I'll just have to read a lot next week.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck.
TrainSen	00010	 I am trying to sell my truck.
TrainSen	00010	 It is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage.
TrainSen	00010	 About 10 miles per gallon.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I will put it on Auto trader and see what I can get for it there.
TrainSen	00010	 My coffee is done and it is calling my name.
TrainSen	00010	 Come.
TrainSen	00010	 Drink me.
TrainSen	00010	 ""   I guess I will just have to wait another.
TrainSen	00010	 oh my gosh.
TrainSen	00010	 10 minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 I am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and I am really tired.
TrainSen	00010	 I have to read six books for my History class.
TrainSen	00010	 It's not so bad I have alreay read one of them and have started on another.
TrainSen	00010	 The first was very boring.
TrainSen	00010	 I think the rest will get better.
TrainSen	00010	 This is a good song.
TrainSen	00010	 I am also taking Chem 302 I think it will be a challenge because I don't really remember Chem 301 that well.
TrainSen	00010	 I kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material.
TrainSen	00010	 What other classes do I have?.
TrainSen	00010	 I am trying to teach myself Spanish right now.
TrainSen	00010	 It is fun.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I can use Spanish a lot later in life.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth/college ministry.
TrainSen	00010	 But who knows what the big guy has in store for me.
TrainSen	00010	 College age has a lot of possibilities.
TrainSen	00010	 I am hoping to maybe get something started this semester.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know how that is going to turn out but I think it will be fun.
TrainSen	00010	 THis last summer me and a couple of friends went to Colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed Mt.
TrainSen	00010	 Elbert (which is the highest peak in the Rockies @ 14,433)  It was a lot of fun.
TrainSen	00010	 I and looking at a picture of me and my friend Chris.
TrainSen	00010	 It is of when we went skydiving last year.
TrainSen	00010	 That was a whole lot of fun.
TrainSen	00010	 ""People may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"".
TrainSen	00010	 Reads a poster on my wall.
TrainSen	00010	 I read it every day to help my fully realize how much more my actions speak than my words.
TrainSen	00010	 I would like to be a great orator but if somebody could only know my through my life practices and not my life speeches I would want them to say that I had a heart like David "".
TrainSen	00010	 a man after God's own heart.
TrainSen	00010	 ""  That would be the testimony of my life.
TrainSen	00010	 I pray that I can life according to the beliefs in which I so strongly hold.
TrainSen	00010	 K2, Everest, Anapurna  some of the greatest peaks in the world.
TrainSen	00010	 I someday wish to climb all of them.
TrainSen	00010	 But we will see how things play themselves out.
TrainSen	00010	 I think it is so funny how people grunt and groan and try to figure it all out.
TrainSen	00010	 The things that are above.
TrainSen	00010	 are always going to be greater than those below.
TrainSen	00010	 And tru faith means you don't have to have all the answers.
TrainSen	10000	I am in my room right now typing with my tv turned on to MTV channel.
TrainSen	10000	 It's playing justin timberlake song.
TrainSen	10000	 I just got back from my biochemistry I class and the professor in that class seems very boring.
TrainSen	10000	 I noticed that he never stop talking in his lecture which makes it hard for me because I feel like I missed a lot of what he said while I was taking notes.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't seem to take notes and listen well at the same time.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel I'm more of a single tasked person.
TrainSen	10000	 Besides the music going on in my room, the water cooker is almost, and I can hear it's boiling right now and I think I need to check on it before the water boils over.
TrainSen	10000	 I'll be back.
TrainSen	10000	 Well, I'm back.
TrainSen	10000	 This week will be a tiring week for me since I have so much to catch up with anthropology reading.
TrainSen	10000	 I pretty much understand my biochemistry professor after a few lectures of how he is not good in lecturing, so that means I have to spend more time reading and studying, which definitely sucks.
TrainSen	10000	 My other teachers are okay and I seem to absorb a lot in their lectures.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't think I can work out much this week and I maybe be able to work out next thursday and saturday.
TrainSen	10000	 Plans for weekends are unsure since I haven't made any.
TrainSen	10000	 Hopefully, there will be something fun that my friends will invite me to.
TrainSen	10000	 I had already met some people in my dorm, but I haven't really met people in my classes.
TrainSen	10000	 I also met the people from Longhorn Pre-Pharmacy Association.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, there is going to be a football game this coming saturday and I don't think I can usher again in the football for the Longhorn PRe-Pharmacy since I haven't finished much in my school work and haven't played really since a long time ago.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope this week and this weekend won't turn out to be terrible.
TrainSen	10000	 It's unexpected that somehow right now I feel more energetic than when I was about an hour ago when I was in biochemistry class.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe professors have a lot of effect on student's energy level or maybe the breakfast that I ate about 3 hours ago now is starting kick in.
TrainSen	10000	 Something about the song in MTV just made me looked at the screen.
TrainSen	10000	 It's R.
TrainSen	10000	 Kelly in a Japanese culture setting, which made me look longer because I am from an asian culture.
TrainSen	10000	 In America, asian culture is not that widely dispersed, so it's good to see it every so often.
TrainSen	10000	 As I'm watching a fighting scene in that R.
TrainSen	10000	 Kelly MTV, I think America has a misleading view toward asian culture because whenever there is something with asian culture, there has to be martial art, which is misleading because asian culture is not just about martial art.
TrainSen	10000	 Instead, we have other things.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't feel like listing  them right now.
TrainSen	10000	 It's good to see rap songs are being more popular because it shows America is diverse and multi culture.
TrainSen	10000	 Speaking of culture, in my anthropology class, we are discussing about culture.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a lot to read on The Forest People, who are people have very different culture from Western and Eastern culture.
TrainSen	00100	I am so glad I made this assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 why do I always leave things to the last moment like this.
TrainSen	00100	 classic Laurie""  ivsuppose.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't even want to write correctly -grammar and punctuations.
TrainSen	00100	 It won't matter though.
TrainSen	00100	 I am looking at all my different rings I have and how shaky my hands feel from working all day.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope my dad will like my apartment.
TrainSen	00100	 and I hope Chris does not find out that Bryan is going with me tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 what am I going to wear.
TrainSen	00100	 what kind of dance will it be.
TrainSen	00100	 will the main dancer be technically perfect or will I sit through the whole performance being annoying and critical.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate lying.
TrainSen	00100	 especially to my best friend.
TrainSen	00100	 I can feel the guilt weigh my arms down.
TrainSen	00100	 right down to my shaky hands.
TrainSen	00100	 the rotating fan keeps whizzing past my face.
TrainSen	00100	 I need a printer.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm surprised chris lets me use hers.
TrainSen	00100	 the marker is going to dry out and chris will get mad.
TrainSen	00100	 her shoes have no shoe laces and are very dirty.
TrainSen	00100	 man I wonder what those things have seen.
TrainSen	00100	 lots of drugs probably! but they are retired now.
TrainSen	00100	 the donnas are very self assured with themselves.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I had a d-cup that people stared at.
TrainSen	00100	 no not really, I like being petite, brenna always complains about her boobs.
TrainSen	00100	 and Misty is getting fake boobs! what a freaking dumbass.
TrainSen	00100	 she is like the classical example of female american mistakes.
TrainSen	00100	 gets married at 19, boob job at 20, child at 21, divorce at 22.
TrainSen	00100	 don't come crying to me because of your bad decisions.
TrainSen	00100	 well no I would be a good friend I just feel very betrayed because she left me! and at a whim at that.
TrainSen	00100	 ugh I wish ollie was not such a bad cat.
TrainSen	00100	 the more I write the heavier my chest, I realize that I write about bullshit! maybe micheal will ask me out, that was what he was ""trying"" to do right? he is cute in a hispanic way and I love different cultures.
TrainSen	00100	 but why is bryan perfect but unreachable.
TrainSen	00100	 I would feel devastated if C  was doing what I was to me.
TrainSen	00100	 why am I sweating.
TrainSen	00100	 haha.
TrainSen	00100	 I am kind of nervous for tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope it won't be awkward with Alex there.
TrainSen	00100	 I told Garry not to worry about Chris.
TrainSen	00100	 shit what do I do.
TrainSen	00100	 ""classic Laurie"" I don't think before actions enough.
TrainSen	00100	 and what the hell am I going to wear tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to have that put together tight look.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe stilettos and hair up.
TrainSen	00100	 shit I am late and I still have 8 minutes of writing left.
TrainSen	00100	 I thought I turned that dryer signal off.
TrainSen	00100	 it irritates me.
TrainSen	00100	 I can hear my bass from my room.
TrainSen	00100	 that means Chris can hear an awful lot.
TrainSen	00100	 ok dad should be here at 8 and I leave at 610.
TrainSen	00100	 arg what to do with Christina.
TrainSen	00100	 eek my phone is ringing, but I won't get it.
TrainSen	00100	 now brennas phone is ringing.
TrainSen	00100	 its a very strange ""why the hell did you put it on that"" ring.
TrainSen	00100	 ahh my fav radiohead song just came on.
TrainSen	00100	 it makes me want to be sad.
TrainSen	00100	 I was talking to CHris last night about depression and how easily slipped into it is.
TrainSen	00100	 I would like just for a day to transform into someone else and see if they feel the same way all the time like its a characteristic of the human race or just me.
TrainSen	00100	 I never close my jaw tight enough and Ill find myself with it hanging and it makes me so angry.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder what everyone else is writing.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to take a shower and chill the fuck out.
TrainSen	00100	 I am turning into my mother.
TrainSen	00100	 it would be nice to have more plants in our apt.
TrainSen	00100	 fix it up more.
TrainSen	00100	 finish a painting.
TrainSen	00100	 crap get canvas materials and you better not forget your books again.
TrainSen	00100	 I really like charles.
TrainSen	00100	 he is a good teacher, I like him because he reminds me of myself except he is 6 ft and black.
TrainSen	00100	 very soft spoken.
TrainSen	00100	 people seem to like me in painting.
TrainSen	00100	 I should talk more tho.
TrainSen	00100	 not like this tho.
TrainSen	00001	I've been thinking a lot lately on the topic of studying other people, using them as test subjects, objectifying human beings, I really feel that it degrades their very being.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't understand another human's need to study and examine what makes another human tick.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish that I could say that I am exempt from this curiosity, but sadly I am not.
TrainSen	00001	 I find myself hypocritically fascinated by the way that people lose themselves in their jobs, in causes, in religion.
TrainSen	00001	 They somehow manage to pound it into their heads that whatever it is that they're involved in is important, means something, when in reality 100% of professions and causes are just as pointless as the lives of the people lost in them.
TrainSen	00001	 None of it will rally matter once these people are gone, and the strange thing is that I think they all know this deep down, they've all had that thought in their life before.
TrainSen	00001	 Yet they still go on, slaving their lives away, building the modern day pharaoh's modern day pyramids.
TrainSen	00001	 Just pawns to those that were lucky enough to be born into wealth.
TrainSen	00001	 God only knows what they would do if they were forced to face the reality of their banal situations.
TrainSen	00001	 Which raises another good topic, religion, now everyone knows that religion is make-believe for grown ups, just another thing to keep perpetuating the myth that our lives matter in some deep and profound way.
TrainSen	00001	 Religion as we know it was made to control the masses, sort of a justification for law, and also something that keeps people inline above law, like a conscience.
TrainSen	00001	 But the religions that we have come up with are so ridiculous we have to implement them to our young at ages when they are too young to tell the difference between real and fake.
TrainSen	00001	 We teach them religion as fact when they are too young to differentiate for themselves the difference between fact and fiction.
TrainSen	00001	 It's funny that we act as if what religion we pick matters, as if one is even different that the others, they all have the same common goal to keep people living in the hierarchy, keep believing that by divine right the rich were born to a life of comfort and luxury and the poor must suffer in order for rich to have such pleasant lives.
TrainSen	00001	 In tribal societies religion doesn't have to be forced on the new generation, rather they welcome it with open arms, just as they aren't forced to work in their lives, rather they do it out of necessity and a primal urge to conform to your own society.
TrainSen	00001	 People allowing themselves to be controlled really bothers me, it's clear that people can live, sustain life, off very little, and will slave their lives away rather than die.
TrainSen	00001	 However I can't comprehend how our society got to this point, where the slave drivers now wear a smile while fucking people in the ass.
TrainSen	00001	 We somehow fib ourselves into believing we need cell phones, computers, tv's, cars, when it's a fact that none of these things even existed 50 years ago.
TrainSen	00001	 People actually lived without any of this bullshit for 3 million years, people just like you and me, people just as smart, and just as naive.
TrainSen	00001	 It's clear that society breeds evil not the other way around, the pilgrims committed mass genocide on the indians, but it is forgiven as they were just spreading the one right way to live, that we have so enlighten found.
TrainSen	00001	 People lived without all this none-sense that we tell ourselves we couldn't live without for nearly 3 million years.
TrainSen	00001	 But those are all things that no one wants you to know, except maybe Daniel Quinn, Derrick Jensen, John Zerzan, and Chuck Palahniuk.
TrainSen	00001	 Those are the men that will save our planet and our existence if it isn't already too late.
TrainSen	00001	 The doomsday clock is set to 40 years from now, that is the point of no return, if things stay the way that they are now, there will be no hope for the future.
TrainSen	00001	 If we had all just stayed with animism, and believed that the earth is not something for us to own, or control, if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives so that we may survive, how could we take away their right to the same land we live on.
TrainSen	00001	 But there are no classes teaching what people really want to know, what they need to know, only classes perpetuating our way of life.
TrainSen	00001	 Only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we don't even notice.
TrainSen	00001	 So why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I realize that my writing may sound bleak, as if I'm in a state of utter depression, that I'm innately sad, but it's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should, and deserves to feel the depression that haunts us all.
TrainSen	00001	 We keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks, making executioner executive decisions.
TrainSen	00001	 But humans shouldn't need pills to control their feelings, they shouldn't need pills to make them happy, they shouldn't need pills to force their inner feelings into submission.
TrainSen	00001	 It pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society, and the people that don't see it, if it isn't already here.
TrainSen	00001	 Our phones are tapped, our emails are spied on, the government we live under even monitors what books we are checking our in order to make sure were not reading anything that could be dangerous.
TrainSen	00001	 People wake up everyday and take zoloft, prosac, ritalin, adderol, valium, zanex, anything that will keep them from deviating from what is considered acceptable behavior, to keep them inline.
TrainSen	00001	 Anything to keep them from focusing on how ridiculous it all is, anything to keep them so fucked up they just don't care anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 Anything to hide the fact that the light at the end of the tunnel has gone out, there is no hope for the future we are writing now, at least none that includes us.
TrainSen	00001	 For a species that holds it self in such hich regard, the top of the food chain, the center of the universe, in our own special classification, we sure act stupidly.
TrainSen	00001	 If we were to open our eyes we'd see that the real criminals are the rich old men living in their mansions, with drugged up kids, both pharasudically, and illegally, allowing oppression, deforestation, slavery, pollution, and the lot to continue everyday, infact they make sure it grows, because you can't stop progress.
TrainSen	00001	 They are very rapidly destroying any traces of another way of life with every indigenous tribe they try to save"" by spreading the word of a god that allows his people to be in a constant state of submission, so that they may enter an endless world of happiness once their life here is over.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm here to tell you that no such place exists, god is just santa clause for adults.
TrainSen	00001	 Where was god when the twin towers were hit, where was god when the indians were wiped out by the white man, where was god when the germans were killing the jews, where is god now when people are so cleverly brainwashed since the time they are born that they don't even notice when they're doing it to their own children.
TrainSen	00001	 I for one would hate to be responsible for bringing another life into this god forsaken waste land.
TrainSen	00001	 Everyday we scorch the earth with new roads, we rip the earth apart for new buildings, we destroy the earth for a made up monetary system.
TrainSen	00001	 No one seems to see the bull shit that is going on here, before civilization no one had to work, in fact tribal people have no concept of work, they do what they have to in order to survive and they spend the rest of their time living, doing whatever it is that they want to.
TrainSen	00001	 We have some how been duped into believing that this way of life is unacceptable, lazy, pointless, a waste, yet we fail to see that our way of life is just as pointless, just as wasteful.
TrainSen	00001	 Only we have to lie to ourselves and children right from the day they are born, because the way we live is so heinous, so vile, so wrong that our children can't handle it, and for the most part neither can we.
TrainSen	00001	 We could change everything in one generation, if we all started living a different way one day the whole system would collapse on itself, but we lie to ourselves and force our own minds to believe that this is right, that this is the way things must be and that there's nothing we can do about it.
TrainSen	01000	I am eating a Hershey's bar with almonds.
TrainSen	01000	 I told myself that I would only eat one little square of it, but as I can see, that didn't happen.
TrainSen	01000	 You would think that eating chocolate would spoil my appetite, but actually it's making me more hungry.
TrainSen	01000	 For more sweets.
TrainSen	01000	 That's interesting.
TrainSen	01000	      As I'm typing, those little notices that people are signing on AOL instant messenger keep popping up, and for some reason the cursor on my laptop keeps moving over the words I've already typed, so I have to keep going back and deleting and starting over.
TrainSen	01000	 Annoying.
TrainSen	01000	    Over the Labor Day weekend, which happened to include my birthday, by the way.
TrainSen	01000	 On that note, I used to not like having a birthday so near a quote ""holiday"" because all of my school friends would have some vacation of some sort planned, and I wouldn't be able to get together with all of them.
TrainSen	01000	 Now that I've entered COLLEGE (smile), I've grown - in two short weeks - to love having a long weekend for my birthday.
TrainSen	01000	 To spend with special people (bigger smile).
TrainSen	01000	 Anyways, this weekend (my computer did that thing again) I celebrated my 18th birthday with my family and my BEST friend.
TrainSen	01000	     My mom used to attend UT Austin, in fact, both of my parents did.
TrainSen	01000	 Unfortunately, due to health complications she was forced to transfer to another college back home.
TrainSen	01000	 Anyways, she is a registered nurse, although she took maternity leave long ago, and at the moment she's decided not to go back to work until my little brother gets into his middle-elementary years.
TrainSen	01000	    My dad is a self-employed architect.
TrainSen	01000	 He used to work for a large corporation in Dallas, but hardly had time to have a life.
TrainSen	01000	 A life away from work, that is.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom likes to say that when I was a baby, she would have to show me a picture - AHHHH! my best friend just called! - she'd say that she would have to show me a picture of my dad and say: ""Look, there's your Daddy.
TrainSen	01000	 ""  Now my brother has the luxury of him coaching his fall baseball teams, and attending soccer practices, and taxi-ing him to karate class and piano lessons.
TrainSen	01000	    My little brother, Matthew, was born when I was nearing 10 years old.
TrainSen	01000	 Currently he is seven years old, in second grade.
TrainSen	01000	 He came as a HUGE surprise, being as how physicians had told my mom that she was infertile.
TrainSen	01000	 But obviously, as my case proved, they were wrong.
TrainSen	01000	 He is very active, and shows so much love that I don't know how such a little body can produce it.
TrainSen	01000	 Right now he's almost infatuated with copying my best friend, Patrick.
TrainSen	01000	    Speaking of Patrick, I met him in high school.
TrainSen	01000	 We both attended Health Careers High School, a magnet school in San Antonio.
TrainSen	01000	 By chance, we've had a few classes together over the years, and, by chance, we only just met each other at the end of senior year.
TrainSen	01000	 That was largely due to our parent's cooperative involvement in putting together Project Graduation for our senior class, to be held the night of graduation.
TrainSen	01000	 Actually, we've been aware of each others presence for awhile now, being as how our school is relatively small in size, housing around 1000 students total; around 204 in my class.
TrainSen	01000	 I didn't get to what I was saying, but I guess I'll leave the juicy stuff for next time.
TrainSen	00001	Seriously in my mind right now I have so many levels of thought that I can easily access by simply starting to think about something, Everything runs in these little spurts of thought but once I analyze them long enough they are all working together to form what I think is the cycle of my mind and it all works together simultaneously and perfect as the world is, because everything has its specific purpose.
TrainSen	00001	 A lot of things that I thought before were just meaningless pieces of metal and serve no purpose in the world are really there for means of our (human) use and that is what they are specifically there for.
TrainSen	00001	 Everything is for us.
TrainSen	00001	 Humans.
TrainSen	00001	 Everything.
TrainSen	00001	 We utilize this world as it is our lemon and we must make as much lemonade for ourselves as we possibly can.
TrainSen	00001	 This alternates from being a very good and positive thing to being a terrible and selfish thing that makes us thing that we all must worry about ourselves and no one else matters unless they are aiding us on our rise to the top of the pitcher of our own lemonade, making sure that on one takes any along the way.
TrainSen	00001	 If someone takes our lemonade, we must simply acknowledge its loss and move on but how much is too much? When and where is the point where the lemonade that is taken is too much and we need it back? But if someone drinks it then we can't get it back, so how much lemonade do we personally owe to others if we are making much more lemonade than they are? Notice please that this lemonade is still very much so a metaphor for what we provide for this world that works specifically for us.
TrainSen	00001	 Even the controversy in the world is there specifically to get others to be mentally in touch with ourselves and make sure that they know our way of thinking.
TrainSen	00001	 Controversy evolves from people trying to get other people to think the way that they do.
TrainSen	00001	 Basically, this is important in deciding which factors of society are more acceptable among a large number of people instead of just one person.
TrainSen	00001	 The more people widely accept a thought, the more it is thought to be what we think as ""normal"" but just because a thought isn't in everyone's mind, then why do we think it is abnormal or crazy? In our minds, social situations and experiences have led most to believe that minor variations in behavior are ""weird"" but this is the main problem with our world.
TrainSen	00001	 If everyone could just accept everyone for the way they are then no one will be right or wrong and the only controversy will be because.
TrainSen	00001	 well there will be no controversy if everyone stops being so damn judgmental all the time, please pardon my language but I felt I must stress the importance of the statement.
TrainSen	00001	 May I please stress it again? Damn, There I did it.
TrainSen	00001	 There is a flaw in our perfect world and if people are wondering why they may be unhappy that is probably why.
TrainSen	00001	 They must accept everything for the way that it is and do their best to utilize what they can without being selfish and they must utilize the time that they have in order to make their life the best that it can be.
TrainSen	00001	 People that are typically unhappy and depressed tend to think that the world needs to be changed but if they stopped thinking like that then they would be happy with the world the way it is and they would no longer be depressed.
TrainSen	00001	 I see the irony in my statements above because I said simply that we must accept the world for what it is, but here's the thing.
TrainSen	00001	 I have personally not yet learned to do this because I still see the flaws of judge mentality in our world that I wish to change or eradicate: the fact that people don't just accept the world and people in their ""out of the ordinary"" state of minds for just the way that it is.
TrainSen	00001	 Simply put.
TrainSen	00001	 the way that it is.
TrainSen	00001	 THE WAY THAT IT IS.
TrainSen	00001	 If I could understand that then I believe that I will have reached a level of happiness that no one could reach.
TrainSen	00001	 I am actually much closer to this state of bliss and happiness than I ever thought I could be.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't think there are any major flaws in our world that I cannot look at with an open mind and.
TrainSen	00001	 accept, if you will.
TrainSen	00001	 I say ""if you will"" because I feel that ""accept"" may not properly convey what it is that I am trying to express.
TrainSen	00001	 By accept, I mean.
TrainSen	00001	 look at something with an inner peace and happiness that yes it exists and it must but why? well who knows and it is okay not to know.
TrainSen	00001	 I need not know the meaning of everything but I have a deep appreciation for it.
TrainSen	00001	 There it is.
TrainSen	00001	 I HAVE A DEEP APPRECIATION FOR IT.
TrainSen	00001	 I was trying to find the phrase that conveyed my sight of the world.
TrainSen	00001	 I appreciate the beauty of the world and the diversity among people's personalities and I choose to embrace everyone not hoping that they will change but hoping that they will continue to open the door that is my mind.
TrainSen	00001	 No one can say they appreciate this until they really feel it.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel it with everything that I do and I only hope that everyone can at one point or another feel this appreciation for people and not to mention mere intimate objects produced by either nature or a human being himself.
TrainSen	00001	 Everything is there for our pleasure and we must utilize it to our best capabilities (without bearing harm to others of course, because that is the definite point where a specific line is crossed), and this is simply our duty to the world.
TrainSen	01000	well another week of classes has started and I can't wait until this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 I just want to relax for a while.
TrainSen	01000	 there is so much to do during the week.
TrainSen	01000	 I start on one thing then I have to work on something else.
TrainSen	01000	 there is like ten million things to do.
TrainSen	01000	 I am taking these hard classes and I hate them.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to read a lot of course, but oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 I have a quiz tomorrow in my Bio 211 discussion class.
TrainSen	01000	 gosh I hope am ready.
TrainSen	01000	 I really want to do well.
TrainSen	01000	 its my first quiz.
TrainSen	01000	 am going to be nervous.
TrainSen	01000	 I did study some last night.
TrainSen	01000	 I am extremely tired because I stayed up late looking over stuff for bio 211.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel I am not fully prepared.
TrainSen	01000	 but then I study so hard I go take the quiz and what if I fail.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate that feeling.
TrainSen	01000	 I study so much but then my hard work wont pay off.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel so awful that I cry, I know crying doesn't do anything.
TrainSen	01000	 but its just you work so hard and you want to do well.
TrainSen	01000	 I am going to study some more tonight though.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go over to jester and go to the learning center for my calculus homework due soon.
TrainSen	01000	 gosh so much to do today.
TrainSen	01000	 right now am just tired and hungry.
TrainSen	01000	 I ate junk food last night.
TrainSen	01000	 the cafeteria was closed and I just didn't feel like going down to the strip by myself.
TrainSen	01000	 I just always want someone there with me.
TrainSen	01000	 I am scared though to walk on the strip by myself.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe this weekend I will walk on the strip in the afternoon by myself.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go look at the stores and just walk and chill out.
TrainSen	01000	 I am just stalk in this cubicle just putting my head into the books.
TrainSen	01000	 its like I need to get out get some fresh air.
TrainSen	01000	 its just am so stressed and I know I got too much to do its like I don't even have 10 minutes to just relax.
TrainSen	01000	 there is so many things to do on campus and I want to join clubs and get to know some new people.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to join like the medical clubs and maybe a Persian club.
TrainSen	01000	 that would be fun.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to meet some Persian people on campus since I am Persian too.
TrainSen	01000	 its fun to meet someone from your own culture.
TrainSen	01000	 you can relate to them and stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 I just need to get out there and explore my possibilities.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to join some clubs not just for writing in you resumes but for fun and to learn and explore and also to meet people who are also interested in the same things you are.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go to the medical field so I need to join some medical organizations.
TrainSen	01000	 I am sure there are many of them.
TrainSen	01000	 I am a biology major and now am thinking to change my major to psychology.
TrainSen	01000	 I think psychology will be an interesting field.
TrainSen	01000	 I talked to my cousin who recently graduated from medical school and she said it would be a great idea.
TrainSen	01000	 I want  to do something that I am interested in and like to study.
TrainSen	01000	 biology is hard but any subject is hard, but now the classes am taking I am just not having fun and its really stressing me out and I want to do something that I will enjoy.
TrainSen	01000	 and I want to get into medical school.
TrainSen	01000	 I am sure every person who applies to medical school like probably most of them are biology majors.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't want to be a biology major.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to stand out.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to be different.
TrainSen	01000	 I also think that if I don't get into medical school then what am I going to do with a biology major besides teaching and maybe working in the lab, but is it really what I want to do? if I don't get into medical school am sure there are many possibilities with a psychology major.
TrainSen	01000	 I can go to graduate school and such and maybe be come a psychologist.
TrainSen	01000	 I think that would be more fun and interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 gosh all am thinking about now is how hungry I am, ha-ha.
TrainSen	01000	 I didn't eat any breakfast this morning even though I have lots of junk food in the dorm room, that I can eat.
TrainSen	01000	 I will wait another hour or so to go have lunch with my roommate.
TrainSen	01000	 my next class isn't until 1230.
TrainSen	01000	 so I have plenty of time until then.
TrainSen	01000	 I am going to study some more for my quiz on tomorrow and maybe I will eat something to before lunch, because right now I am way too hungry.
TrainSen	01000	 I am glad I have some food in here.
TrainSen	01000	 its not healthy but I am just way too hungry.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to take a nap too, but am not going to I will try to go to bed early tonight maybe.
TrainSen	01000	 well see how long it will take to finish up at the learning center.
TrainSen	01000	 hopefully I can be done by 9 or 930.
TrainSen	01000	 I am going to leave the dorm around 630 or so, so I can be at jester by 7.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to finish my calculus homework so I wont have to worry about it that much.
TrainSen	01000	 I already got enough stuff to worry about and do.
TrainSen	01000	 I just want tomorrow to be over with.
TrainSen	01000	 after tomorrow's quiz I think I will be okay.
TrainSen	00001	Wow, hell week at the chi phi really put me back.
TrainSen	00001	 I have homework out the ass.
TrainSen	00001	 Damn I type really slow.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I could type faster.
TrainSen	00001	 This song I'm listening to wasn't so bad.
TrainSen	00001	 The next song I don't recognize, oh yea I do , hell yaw this song is great.
TrainSen	00001	 time sure does go by.
TrainSen	00001	 Wow this song really fits me maybe I should just roll with it.
TrainSen	00001	 no more stalling just go and roll with it.
TrainSen	00001	 May I should just do it.
TrainSen	00001	 Fine the next time I see Dina I just let her know how I feel.
TrainSen	00001	 This writing assignment is really making me hate all of those people who type fast.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I should have taken a typing class in high school.
TrainSen	00001	 Damn this song brings back way to many memories.
TrainSen	00001	 It always make me stop and think about the girl that I like at that time.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I'm thinking about Dina, she is just so nice.
TrainSen	00001	 It just kind of grew and since we started out as friends it's hard to just transition into a relationship.
TrainSen	00001	 Hopefully the feelings are not all one sided.
TrainSen	00001	 Well I have plenty of time I see her almost every day.
TrainSen	00001	 But if I wait too long she will become a permanent friend and I would have lost my chance.
TrainSen	00001	 She is also my Spanish tutor so then my Spanish will be tied to my relationship.
TrainSen	00001	 She has so much patience for me though.
TrainSen	00001	 She can be my sugar momma.
TrainSen	00001	 Damn I really can't stop thinking about here.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder why here phone wasn't working today, I kind of glad though.
TrainSen	00001	 I need more time to think things out and its not always to do things in the spur of the moment.
TrainSen	00001	 The tickets I got for the game suck.
TrainSen	00001	 I can actually spit on the rice fans from my spot.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well, I got an extra ticket for Dina, I'm actually glad I could only get one extra ticket.
TrainSen	00001	 Now here friend can't come with us.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm felling really anti-social lately.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not really hyper or energetic either.
TrainSen	00001	 And have been sick with a soar throat and stuffy nose.
TrainSen	00001	 I just want a few days to catch up.
TrainSen	00001	 This assignment is almost over .
TrainSen	00001	 I bet almost everyone else has more written then me.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 Hey now.
TrainSen	00001	 I have too many posters It looks like a kids room in here.
TrainSen	10000	So I'm not sure on what I'm supposed to be typing about.
TrainSen	10000	 What I smell, taste, feel like??? Well I'm chewing gum.
TrainSen	10000	 I've been chewing it for over like 3 hours now.
TrainSen	10000	 I hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth.
TrainSen	10000	 My gum got hard a long time ago.
TrainSen	10000	 But somehow the flavor is still intact.
TrainSen	10000	 It's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 2 minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 However, I've noticed that Wrigley's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time.
TrainSen	10000	 There are many pictures on my wall.
TrainSen	10000	 I stuck all these pics up like 2 days ago.
TrainSen	10000	 There are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't have one of my family up there.
TrainSen	10000	 I kind of feel bad in a way.
TrainSen	10000	 But I don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a picture of them in my drawer if I ever need to see them.
TrainSen	10000	 But I think it's better with them in my drawer.
TrainSen	10000	 Every time I look up at these pictures of all my friends, I miss them like no other.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I had so much fun last year, in high school in general.
TrainSen	10000	 But last year was definitely the best year.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, me, Caroline, and Shaheen in government and Spanish.
TrainSen	10000	 Those were some good times.
TrainSen	10000	 I kind of even miss my teachers.
TrainSen	10000	 And our elephants and doing SCN all the time.
TrainSen	10000	 We have so many inside jokes.
TrainSen	10000	 And although I'm sure I'll see Caroline again, I'm afraid that when I meet her things won't be the same.
TrainSen	10000	 And for some reason I'm scared of that.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I can go to LSU in the spring.
TrainSen	10000	 Or actually, I hope Caroline can come to Houston for Thanksgiving.
TrainSen	10000	 Or both would be the best.
TrainSen	10000	 And we can't forget about going to Europe next summer.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with Xerx and Zahra.
TrainSen	10000	 But now with this whole separation thing, I know that our traveling days with the Tegra family are over.
TrainSen	10000	 Those were some fun trips too.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel so blessed to have a friend like Xerx.
TrainSen	10000	 And even Zubin and stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 People that I've known my whole life.
TrainSen	10000	 That even know I don't see them too often, when I do, you can tell that there's something there.
TrainSen	10000	 Like I feel so close to them cause I practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents.
TrainSen	10000	 It's a really nice feeling.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm also blessed for Shenz and the whole family.
TrainSen	10000	 God, Shenz and Fred really do care about me and Tash like we were their own kids.
TrainSen	10000	 And just knowing that really means a lot to me.
TrainSen	10000	 And I hope that mom feels the same way about Zareen cause that would only be fair.
TrainSen	10000	 So we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and I'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all.
TrainSen	10000	 But I love the Professor; we call him Dr.
TrainSen	10000	 EO.
TrainSen	10000	 Hahaha, he's really cool.
TrainSen	10000	 Like I walk into his class and he's like ""do you want a drink?"" Wow, I was like thinking ""what is this?"" Oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads.
TrainSen	10000	 The office kind of reminds me of the The Vinci Code.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know why, maybe the whole ""Louvre"" idea.
TrainSen	10000	 I always say I hate France and stuff but I really don't.
TrainSen	10000	 I just think it's kind of funny to say that.
TrainSen	10000	 But I really don't know why it's funny.
TrainSen	10000	 But I mean I've said it so many times now that I really think I've instilled the idea into my head.
TrainSen	10000	 Like I really don't want to travel to France in the summer.
TrainSen	10000	 But I mean if Caroline wants to, then I really don't care.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I'm pretty easy going when it comes to life.
TrainSen	10000	 Like about my grades- I mean if I don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? I mean, I'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school.
TrainSen	10000	 But I mean if for whatever reason I don't, then I think I'll be ok.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean, it's not like I'm going to die or anything.
TrainSen	10000	 Plus, if I have my own family then I don't think I'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, it's a complicated issue.
TrainSen	10000	 We got a phone in our room, the same one I had in my room at home.
TrainSen	10000	 But I haven't used it once here.
TrainSen	10000	 If anything, Jennifer has used it way more than me.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause I don't want them calling in case they call when I'm not here and then have to talk to Jennifer.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of, them talking to Jennifer or Jennifer talking to them.
TrainSen	10000	 No, but Jennifer's really cool.
TrainSen	10000	 But so is Joanna's roommate.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I wish I had a roommate like her.
TrainSen	10000	 Dude, me and Jennifer need to start hanging out more often.
TrainSen	10000	 But I never want us to have the same friends.
TrainSen	10000	 John is one of Jennifer's friends.
TrainSen	10000	 Majoring in Japanese and stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all.
TrainSen	10000	 I've always wanted to take some random language like Japanese.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are.
TrainSen	00010	This must be the easiest and hardest writing assignment ever.
TrainSen	00010	 There is nothing easier in a writing assignment when context and grammar doesn't matter, but there's nothing harder when one has nothing to write about.
TrainSen	00010	 OK, how am I feeling? Hmm.
TrainSen	00010	 I have a light headache and my contacts are bothering me.
TrainSen	00010	 Right when I wrote ""light"" headache, it started to hurt even more.
TrainSen	00010	        Anyways, in class Pennebaker did this statistical project or what not between people who are afraid of death are more likely to support Bush.
TrainSen	00010	 Then, people who are more terrified of terrorists are more likely to support Bush.
TrainSen	00010	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00010	 I on the other hand, am not terrified of terrorist because I support Bush and feel safe with his leadership.
TrainSen	00010	 That's how I would see it.
TrainSen	00010	 If you are not afraid of terrorism, then you must think that Bush is doing a fantastic job with keeping America safe.
TrainSen	00010	        Oh man, it's only been five minutes and my wrists are already starting to hurt.
TrainSen	00010	 hmm, maybe I'll just type slower.
TrainSen	00010	         My eyes are bothering me.
TrainSen	00010	 Man this really sucks that I can't use the tab button to indent.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't really want to keep pressing the space button because I am lazy and my wrist hurts.
TrainSen	00010	 Ok forget any form of organization.
TrainSen	00010	 I'll just babble about nothing.
TrainSen	00010	 My eyes are watery.
TrainSen	00010	 I bet it's due to my stupid contacts.
TrainSen	00010	 My nose is runny too.
TrainSen	00010	 Hehehe snot is gross.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder when anyone will ever read this.
TrainSen	00010	 Never.
TrainSen	00010	 Completion grade.
TrainSen	00010	 Yay! Ok what am I thinking.
TrainSen	00010	 I am thinking that I need to think of something so I can type whatever that thing is that I think ok.
TrainSen	00010	 This is hurting my brain.
TrainSen	00010	 I bet this is great for my headache.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow, nine minutes already.
TrainSen	00010	 This looks pretty lengthy.
TrainSen	00010	 Ok I am positive that no one will ever read this.
TrainSen	00010	 I mean who is going to read 300 plus random thoughts.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow I just felt pressure to make mine interesting and jestful.
TrainSen	00010	 What if mine is the most boring writing essay.
TrainSen	00010	 No way, I bet that there's way more boring-er people than I am.
TrainSen	00010	 I am just so cool like that.
TrainSen	00010	 hehe no not really.
TrainSen	00010	 Ok ::sigh:: 11 minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow.
TrainSen	00010	 Time just slowed down.
TrainSen	00010	 Ok I'm out of things to think once again.
TrainSen	00010	 I rather be sleeping.
TrainSen	00010	 It's in the afternoon and I just had lunch.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to take a nap.
TrainSen	00010	 Like pigs, they take a nap after they eat.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm a pig.
TrainSen	00010	 Only one minute has passed.
TrainSen	00010	 What is this assignment suppose to prove.
TrainSen	00010	 That class is composed of 300 hamsters in an experiment.
TrainSen	00010	 Don't get me wrong.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't mind.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm in a fishbowl.
TrainSen	00010	 Who's not a fishbowl? I am getting very sleepy.
TrainSen	00010	 hehe I just thought of those guys who use a watch to hypnotize someone till they fall asleep and they say ""you are getting very sleepy"" in this creepy tone.
TrainSen	00010	 well I feel like one of those guys being hypnotized.
TrainSen	00010	 yayayaya! only 5 minutes to go! wow this is the best writing assignment ever.
TrainSen	00010	 this should count for %50 of our grade.
TrainSen	00010	 it's only fair.
TrainSen	00010	 ok ok ok what am I thinking? I am thinking that I should be thinking of something to think of.
TrainSen	00010	 ha that was gay.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm hungry already and I just ate rice and steak.
TrainSen	00010	 man I am a pig.
TrainSen	00010	 I just have a big stomach capacity, I can't help it.
TrainSen	00010	 headache.
TrainSen	00010	 snot.
TrainSen	00010	 itchy eyes.
TrainSen	00010	 3 minutes to go.
TrainSen	00010	 I would be so mad if this whole thing got erased.
TrainSen	00010	 hmm I wonder what everyone else is writing about.
TrainSen	00010	 oh no, what if theirs is more articuling and witty.
TrainSen	00010	 oh well I don't care.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate competition.
TrainSen	00010	 ha-ha ut's the best place for that.
TrainSen	00010	 oh my gosh the count down begins.
TrainSen	00010	 we have seconds left ladies and gentlemen.
TrainSen	00010	 After much ado this fun is coming to an end.
TrainSen	00010	 I must say it has been lots of fun.
TrainSen	00100	It's amazing how much free time you have in college.
TrainSen	00100	 A totally different experience from when I was in my grade school years.
TrainSen	00100	 Grade school, seems like I was in the 5th grade.
TrainSen	00100	 It's hard to believe that my high school years were actually my grade school years as well and now I'm in a place of 60,000 people where you're lucky if 50 people know who you are.
TrainSen	00100	 But with all this free time, it's hard to fill it with stuff to do all the time.
TrainSen	00100	 Naps are a great way of filling up lots of hours, but you can only sleep so much.
TrainSen	00100	 I remember laying in bed last night and having a feeling of homesickness even though I only live 20 minutes away and can go home with the push of seven digits.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel bad for the people who are from small towns a million miles away.
TrainSen	00100	 Not only are they far from home, but being thrown into the fire that is UT and surviving is a difficult task for anyone, let alone coming from towns 1/30 the size of UT.
TrainSen	00100	 But I've been enjoying my college experience so far.
TrainSen	00100	 Being able to sleep late, wake up late, take 3 hour naps, all of it.
TrainSen	00100	 Not having to sit in a classroom for an hour and half every other day is a major plus as well.
TrainSen	00100	 Come to think of it, I have no idea how I sat through those days and actually was focused for its entirety.
TrainSen	00100	 The Xbox is calling my name as I write, taunting me with glimpses of football and shooting.
TrainSen	00100	 It's amazing how people think that video games are responsible for their child being violent and whatnot.
TrainSen	00100	 Parents are blaming a series of circuits and programs as the reason their kid is messed up?  If people were being better parents, these kids would have better things to do than rot their brains in front of a TV screen.
TrainSen	00100	 In today's world of money money and more money, it's hard to find time to put aside what is quite important in the world and spending time with the people that matter most.
TrainSen	00100	 Not that TV's bad.
TrainSen	00100	 Heck, I watch way too much of it myself, but my parents also ingrained in me the difference between right and wrong and I was lucky enough to be born right before the start of the technological age, so I get the best of what the world has to offered right now but had my values and beliefs ingrained in me before this ever-growingly corrupt world took over.
TrainSen	00100	 Growingly, is that a word?  It's hard to write for twenty minutes straight without going off on a tangent and starting to focus on other things, like the Schlotsky's cup sitting in front of my desk that's been sitting there for a few days and is probably starting to be a safe haven for mold.
TrainSen	00100	 Speaking of which, there is also a box of fajita toppings that have been sitting in our refrigerator since school started, and yet even though I remember, I still don't get off my butt and throw it out.
TrainSen	00100	 I keep telling myself that I'll do it when I actually take out the trash but heck, we only take the trash out like, once a week.
TrainSen	00100	 I remember doing a stream of consciousness writing as one of my creative works in high school for a book we read because I thought that stream of consciousness writings would be really simple.
TrainSen	00100	 Heck, you just write whatever comes to your head.
TrainSen	00100	 Not too hard right?  But man, I think I've grown up in a very rigidly structured school system and always have to plan stuff out before I actually start writing.
TrainSen	00100	 So I found myself doing more thinking than writing, trying to find the right words and grammar usages so that my ""paper"" wouldn't sound like a first grader wrote it.
TrainSen	00100	 But sometimes that's what a stream of consciousness writing has to be.
TrainSen	00100	 It doesn't matter if you use fifty letter words or ""big,"" because these writings aren't about the content, they're about collecting your thoughts and putting them down no matter how random they be.
TrainSen	00100	 I found it funny how when you gave out this assignment and asked if there were any questions, 20 hands shot up in the air.
TrainSen	00100	 Questions arose like, how many paragraphs? How many words?  What's the structure?  We grow up in a world of rules, where everything is set out before us and we either follow or be considered a problem child.
TrainSen	00100	 We spend more time defining the box rather than thinking outside it.
TrainSen	00100	 Heck, we rarely even spend time thinking inside of it.
TrainSen	00100	 My dad's friend is starting this school in which they let kids pretty much do whatever they want.
TrainSen	00100	 They provide guidance but not rules, set boundaries but don't fence the kids in.
TrainSen	00100	 Their objective is to let the kid develop his or her own self-discipline, not letting some adult develop it for him or her so that when they get out into the real world, they don't curl up into a little ball and hide or rebel and go crazy and not know what they're doing.
TrainSen	00100	 While I think it's a pretty cool idea, others reject the fact that a school like this exists because people are ingrained with rules, their lives governed by the boundaries of the box.
TrainSen	00100	 So hopefully, someday, people will be able to think for themselves, that we won't become robots that only exist because God told us we could exist at the time that we do exist.
TrainSen	10000	Today has not been a very good day for me.
TrainSen	10000	 I found out that my roommate is secretly dating my ex-boyfriend behind my back.
TrainSen	10000	 My friend and I caught them together last night in the courtyard outside of my dorm.
TrainSen	10000	 This is one of the worst feeling I have ever felt.
TrainSen	10000	 I am dating a boy right now, but  the feelings for my ex have started to resurface.
TrainSen	10000	 She fully knows that I like him, but she is deceiving me.
TrainSen	10000	 I was very irritable today and I was rude to a lot of people.
TrainSen	10000	 I really am not a rude person, I just do not understand why people find it necessary to take advantage of my niceness.
TrainSen	10000	 I went to Pappasito's last night to pick up some to go food.
TrainSen	10000	 It is sitting in my refrigerator and I am very anxious to eat it.
TrainSen	10000	 I already had some chips, salsa, queso, and guacamole today.
TrainSen	10000	 I love Mexican food.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a French test tomorrow.
TrainSen	10000	 This is our second test.
TrainSen	10000	 I thought I made an A on the last test, but when I got it back I found a much lower grade.
TrainSen	10000	 It upset me, so I am going to study very hard for this test.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I have a 4.
TrainSen	10000	 0 at the university, and I want to keep it as close to that as possible.
TrainSen	10000	 I have noticed while typing this that I never capitalize 'I'.
TrainSen	10000	 I have gone back and fixed my work at least ten times.
TrainSen	10000	 I am used to typing informally online, where grammar and capitalization does not matter.
TrainSen	10000	 My roommate just left for an environmentalist meeting, and I wanted to go read some of her AIM logs.
TrainSen	10000	 So, I walked over to her computer and was starting to read some when the door started to shake and I thought I heard  her key in the door.
TrainSen	10000	 I was so scared that she was going to come in and catch me.
TrainSen	10000	 From that experience I have realized that I don't want to be snooping in her stuff anymore.
TrainSen	10000	 It would not be worth it if she came in and caught me.
TrainSen	10000	 We already are going to be on semi-bad terms after I talk to her tonight about Chris.
TrainSen	10000	 One of our good friends thinks that once I talk to her about it she will drop the whole thing.
TrainSen	10000	 He said that she felt really bad about going behind my back and she knew it was ""too good to be true"".
TrainSen	10000	 Oh come on.
TrainSen	10000	 She met him like three days ago, there is no way she likes him that much.
TrainSen	10000	 It just hurts me so bad to know that she ignores our friendship  and goes after something that she knows will hurt me.
TrainSen	10000	 Last night our friend talked to her about it and told her that she needed to drop it or else neither of us would talk to her.
TrainSen	10000	 She told him that she was not sure what she wanted to do because Chris is ""special"".
TrainSen	10000	 That is what got to me the most.
TrainSen	10000	 She is willing to throw away two friendships for a boy she just met like 3 days ago.
TrainSen	10000	 I am already stressed out enough with school, I do not need roommate problems.
TrainSen	10000	 This is the reason I do not hang out with girls, they do this sort of thing to each other.
TrainSen	10000	 My guy friends have never hurt me intentionally like this.
TrainSen	10000	 When they try to get to me, they use force.
TrainSen	10000	 Like one time my guy friends all attacked me with pillows.
TrainSen	10000	 It got frustrating, but I did not get emotionally hurt by it.
TrainSen	10000	 Girls get you in the worst possible way.
TrainSen	10000	 Tonight Mean Girls is showing at the Union.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to go see it so bad because I love that movie.
TrainSen	10000	 It is so good.
TrainSen	10000	 I would go see it if I did not have to do all of this homework.
TrainSen	10000	 I already had a test last week in French, I am upset that there is another one this week.
TrainSen	10000	 Our teacher also assigns us homework on the night before our test.
TrainSen	10000	 It is safe to say that we are going to be studying for the test, so there is no need to assign homework.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well.
TrainSen	10000	 I have not done laundry since I arrived here in Austin.
TrainSen	10000	 I am down to my last pants and shorts.
TrainSen	10000	 I will probably do some tonight, if I don't get too lazy.
TrainSen	10000	 I have treated this writing assignment as like a journal.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a lot of stuff on my mind from this whole roommate thing, so it is good that I could write it all out.
TrainSen	10000	 It has been kind of hard to keep writing constantly.
TrainSen	10000	 My hand are getting kind of numb.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it is because I never use the shift key to capitalize things, and now I have to.
TrainSen	10000	 Well, my time has come to an end.
TrainSen	10000	 Time to get back to more homework.
TrainSen	01000	Hey you, So far so good, I've got Chem done and don't have to worry about this when I finish typing.
TrainSen	01000	 wish I could type faster, without the errors too, that'd be great.
TrainSen	01000	 Like Tony the tiger.
TrainSen	01000	 Anyways, I'm happy as of the moment.
TrainSen	01000	 I get to see Anthony today, and any day that that happens is a good day for me.
TrainSen	01000	 (At least, most of the time)  =)   I like rings, that was the only thing I could think of.
TrainSen	01000	 Sometimes when I write, (normally I write letters/notes to people) in this ""stream of consciousness ( which is a pain to spell) type of writing.
TrainSen	01000	 But sometimes I try to be random and that just isn't fair to anyone.
TrainSen	01000	 I  don't like this delete button, (I just don't like the fact I have to use it so much) anyways.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been waking up on time so far.
TrainSen	01000	 What has it been, 5 days? dear me, I'll never keep it up, being such not a morning person and all.
TrainSen	01000	 But maybe I'll adjust, or not.
TrainSen	01000	 I want internet access in my room, I don't' have it yet, but I will on Wed??? I think.
TrainSen	01000	 But that ain't soon enough, cause I got calculus homework due by then, and I hate using the library computers or Jackie's.
TrainSen	01000	 She's such a good friend, what would I ever do without her? no one knows.
TrainSen	01000	 not even me, or you, whoever you are.
TrainSen	01000	 Sorry I'm not interesting today, must have picked a bad day.
TrainSen	01000	 The phrase ""academics first"" just seems to be such a lie.
TrainSen	01000	 Cause everywhere you go, it seems that ""athletics is first"" or at least that's how it is in high school.
TrainSen	01000	 Where you're AP physics teacher is also the softball coach and miss 1 class every week, (and you only have 2 or 3 classes a week to begin with) anyways.
TrainSen	01000	 it's a pet peeve of mine.
TrainSen	01000	 What others do I have? I'm not sure at the moment, I'm not sure about a lot of things though.
TrainSen	01000	 Anthony is always saying ""you don't' know a lot do you?"" and it's true, cause when I don't' know, I don't know, and I admit it.
TrainSen	01000	 I wanted to take that polygraph test yesterday.
TrainSen	01000	 I always wanted to see if I could beat one.
TrainSen	01000	 But I can't lie very well to begin with.
TrainSen	01000	 Can't lie to Mom, Jackie, and Anthony.
TrainSen	01000	 but everyone else I can pass a few things by.
TrainSen	01000	 By the way, (there's is nothing to add on to that, it was just what I thought) That's what you get when you assign this type of assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 but I'm not complaining, I really enjoy it.
TrainSen	01000	 it lets me think.
TrainSen	01000	 cause when I think in my head, it doesn't' really work, I still don't know what I'm thinking.
TrainSen	01000	 but when I write it, then I can at least see what I'm trying to think.
TrainSen	01000	 My finger nails keep getting in the way of my typing.
TrainSen	01000	 I must sound like a hick when I talk/type.
TrainSen	01000	 but that's okay, cause I'm Texan and if that's what it takes to be Texan, then so be it.
TrainSen	01000	 Damn don't' I sound spiffy.
TrainSen	01000	 (not really) don't' know why people (Anthony) hates Texas so much.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean, common on! It don't ever get cold.
TrainSen	01000	 That's the best part.
TrainSen	01000	 (well it does sometimes, but not as much as other places)  Finish.
TrainSen	01000	 I type what I read, and then go from there.
TrainSen	01000	 Can you find the ""finish button"".
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, yesterday I had the overbearing urge to watch the ""fox and the hound"".
TrainSen	01000	 Why? I don't' know.
TrainSen	01000	 Don't' care to much either.
TrainSen	01000	 ""Hi I'm Copper!.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm Todd.
TrainSen	01000	 "" One D or two.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't' know.
TrainSen	01000	 Don't' think I care too much either about that.
TrainSen	01000	 What do I care about? Can't think of anything at the moment, but I'm sure there is something.
TrainSen	01000	 Anthony, grades.
TrainSen	01000	 (Anthony's my Boy friend by the way) Look, there's that phrase, ""by the way' again.
TrainSen	01000	 BTW.
TrainSen	01000	 Blah.
TrainSen	01000	 that always reminds me of Jackie, (my friend, happy PR chick) ""Blah"" does.
TrainSen	01000	 She says it a lot, and now I'm saying it a little more.
TrainSen	01000	 Hmmm.
TrainSen	01000	 2 mins!   The brisket will be ready in 1 hour!.
TrainSen	01000	 sorry that commercial always pops up in my head when I start counting down.
TrainSen	01000	 Down the hill, over the hill.
TrainSen	01000	 Where's grandmother? Who knows? I guess I Don't.
TrainSen	01000	 Do you? Good question.
TrainSen	01000	 bye for now, farewell.
TrainSen	01000	 Godspeed.
TrainSen	01000	 Choa! Bye.
TrainSen	01000	 ~ME.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh I didn't know that we could keep going after the ending.
TrainSen	01000	 I was all prepared to stop and all.
TrainSen	01000	 Well I'd keep writing, but I'm sure I have stuff to do, and this ain't ever going to be read anyways.
TrainSen	01000	 so adios amigos!.
TrainSen	01000	 ~ME Man, I type slow.
TrainSen	00100	Well, I'm 18 years old now and I'm in college.
TrainSen	00100	 So far it has been kind of boring really and I still have not received my math book so that kind of ruins everything.
TrainSen	00100	 Ok not everything but it's not a good thing and wow 20 minutes is a long time.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to watch this show on television but  I guess I won't so let's see what else I am thinking.
TrainSen	00100	 The dryer is kind of loud and only 2 minutes have passed since I've been typing nonsense.
TrainSen	00100	 School is also exhausting.
TrainSen	00100	 I take naps like everyday and you know I actually like writing about nothing because why?  Hmm.
TrainSen	00100	 Well, because I'm not stuck with a certain topic and I just have to decide what to write about.
TrainSen	00100	 I would talk about smell but there is nothing exquisite in the air right now if that makes any sense.
TrainSen	00100	 However, about 1 hour ago I was eating meatloaf that my brother made and it was pretty good but now I'm hungry again because I didn't have much to eat.
TrainSen	00100	 So I'm thinking of going to Starbucks and getting some delicious Mocha Frappucino.
TrainSen	00100	 Is that spelt with 1 or 2 ""c's"".
TrainSen	00100	 Anyways before I go to Starbucks I may go to the weight room hopefully not the one at UT because I may still have other assignments to attend to and UT is too far of a distance.
TrainSen	00100	 Man I wonder what time Starbucks is closed.
TrainSen	00100	 I also want some ice cream.
TrainSen	00100	 I sure hope that I don't gain the Freshman 15 because that would really suck.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope that doesn't offend whomever has to read this because I didn't mean to.
TrainSen	00100	 I sure hope that I learn to manage my time later on or sooner actually.
TrainSen	00100	 My throat or something hurts and I wish that I could just sleep all day.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate some of my classes and I hate being in the Gateway Program.
TrainSen	00100	 It's alright but not what I expected.
TrainSen	00100	 I definitely didn't expect to take a class for that program but I am stuck in the most boring of boring classrooms.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like what am I doing there and can I get out of the program without hurting the Coordinator?  Also, when should I try to get out of the program?  6 more minutes to go.
TrainSen	00100	 what to talk about? what to talk about?  Oh yeah, I had a fever last week and I hope that I don't get sick again this year.
TrainSen	00100	 Another thing about the Gateway program is that I have to go to some social events and that takes time out of my life.
TrainSen	00100	 I definitely don't know what to do.
TrainSen	00100	 They like helped me register or whatever and I have to wait 3 hours and 30 minutes on MWF before my last class on those days which is Psychology and I have no idea what to do during that time and I tend to feel drowsy or sleepy during that class.
TrainSen	00100	 Sorry.
TrainSen	00100	 2 more minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm looking at this sheet and I have no idea what to do with my UT email address and how to get into it.
TrainSen	00100	 Does that make me dumb?  I wonder if I'm even going to get a response for that question.
TrainSen	00100	 yeah 9 more seconds.
TrainSen	10000	well its Sunday night and I'm just chilling in the room.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm enjoying not having my roommate here.
TrainSen	10000	 it is so nice to just do whatever without someone here talking and making noise and talking to everyone under the sun on the phone.
TrainSen	10000	 that's what my roommate does.
TrainSen	10000	 instead of going out like a normal college student she sits in the room and talks to her parents like a million times a day.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess whatever floats her boat though so whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 as long as we are ok with me going out and coming in whenever I want then we have no problems.
TrainSen	10000	 last night was pretty fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I went to sixth street for the first time and had my first legal clubbing experience.
TrainSen	10000	 I kind of got hooked up with this guy that game with my friend so that was fine except he wasn't that good of a dancer because he couldn't keep up with my rhythm but it was fun anyways.
TrainSen	10000	 the funnest was on Friday when me and Kayla went to the hitching post where the iron spikes were having their recruiting party.
TrainSen	10000	 we drank and had lots of fun then we got to spend the night at this guys apartment that I met at camp Texas.
TrainSen	10000	 he was a counselor that I had spent the entire first morning talking to about just whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 I really didn't think anything of it at the time because I thought it would be like off limits to have any kind of fling with the counselors so I kind of kept my distance.
TrainSen	10000	 I e-mailed him once school got started just to see how everything was going and see if he still remembered me.
TrainSen	10000	 he did, which was good.
TrainSen	10000	 I was hoping he would.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I kind of like him but I have no idea what he thinks about the whole situation so I'm not going to stress over because it is so not worth it.
TrainSen	10000	 and plus he is the guy and I grew up in a place where the guy always made the first move so I'm not all about jumping in here with my opinion and try to get something started.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe that's my problem.
TrainSen	10000	 when I want something I tend to let it come to me and I just wait around till something happens.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe I should go after the things I want.
TrainSen	10000	 speaking of things that I want, I applied to be a Texas lasso.
TrainSen	10000	 I got a call back today saying that they wanted me to come in for an interview.
TrainSen	10000	 I was so excited.
TrainSen	10000	 I have wanted to join something like this ever since I got to campus.
TrainSen	10000	 they do everything, from socials to community service.
TrainSen	10000	 I heard about it from the guy that invited me to the iron spikes party this past Friday.
TrainSen	10000	 he is an iron spike and he suggested I look into it because he thought I would enjoy it.
TrainSen	10000	 and the lassos do social events and stuff with them so maybe I could be able to hang out with Joe a little more but whatever about that.
TrainSen	10000	 I really hope I get in to this because I really want to be apart of something and have those group of friends that are in the same position as me that I can always count on to be around for me to go out with and things like that.
TrainSen	10000	 I have been recently hanging out with Kayla who is one of the girls I met at orientation.
TrainSen	10000	 we do everything together and she just got into longhorn singers so that pretty much takes up all her social time now.
TrainSen	10000	 that's why I want to get involved in something of my own so I wont have to sit around my room waiting for a time when she can do stuff with me.
TrainSen	10000	 that's not what college is all about.
TrainSen	10000	 its about having fun and enjoying yourself, not sitting around your room all day and only coming out for food or class like my roommate.
TrainSen	10000	 she is trying to get involved though.
TrainSen	10000	 she signed up for the rowing team so we'll see how that works out.
TrainSen	10000	 it seems kind of weird to me but whatever floats her boat.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm no one to judge.
TrainSen	10000	 I have got the music on my computer going and the TV so there is all kinds of stuff to keep me occupied while I sit here and type for twenty minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 I have like five minutes left so that's good because I'm kind of getting tired of typing.
TrainSen	10000	 tomorrow me, Kayla, and her roommate sheik are going shopping at Barton creek mall! I am very excited about that because I love to shop and I want some big sunglasses.
TrainSen	10000	 I have seen lots around campus and I want some of my own.
TrainSen	10000	 I really don't want anything else but u never know once you get going.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm  a big shoe fanatic so hopefully no shoes will impress me because I will buy them and add to the collection in my room.
TrainSen	10000	 its going to be fun whether I get stuff or not because I just love shopping in general that's why my major is retail merchandising.
TrainSen	10000	 I will get to shop for a major company like mace's or Nordstrom or even tiffany's.
TrainSen	10000	 that is my dream.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to have a base office in new York city and then travel all over buying merchandise for my company.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to eventually be head person because I don't like being under someone else's control.
TrainSen	10000	 but I know ill have to start from the bottom which is fine but u better believe I will work my butt off to fulfill my goals and dreams.
TrainSen	10000	 my parents have been wanting me to come home for a weekend but I think not yet.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't want to miss anything up here.
TrainSen	00010	I just read in Alfred Adler's Understanding Human Nature that a person's psyche and action is driven by an ultimate goal, and that that goal is irreversibly influenced by experiences, emotions, failures, and other memories from childhood.
TrainSen	00010	 And I consider how closely indeed my present ambitions are tied to my trauma and exhilaration as a young child.
TrainSen	00010	 Now, I feel the only way I can attain happiness is to create something.
TrainSen	00010	 To form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to see my doubt, anger, passion, fear, fascination, and every substance of my mind materialize.
TrainSen	00010	 Now, in this search to form and mold the outer world, I turn to literature, to books and stories of others, tales with which I can empathize and understand.
TrainSen	00010	 My hunger for reading is insatiable.
TrainSen	00010	 Everything from novels, to scientific articles, to textbooks, to philosophical papers, I want it all.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to absorb it so that I don't miss an ounce of life.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to share every shape and substance of time, to reflect on all thoughts before me so that I can mold those after.
TrainSen	00010	 And in all of this, with all the knowledge, as I absorb the mind of others through their literary creations, I feel great anxiety in that I have not made a contribution of my own.
TrainSen	00010	 Many projects that I saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short.
TrainSen	00010	 My passions flow like a liquid, undulating and turning over, never constant, never culminating into a final insight or enlightenment.
TrainSen	00010	 Several novels begun on my own, yet my mind drifts to other settings, other plots and themes, other characters and personalities.
TrainSen	00010	 I can never immerse myself in the fictitious, because my own thoughts are unstable.
TrainSen	00010	 The worlds I put on paper dissolve, evaporate and disintegrate into the torrent of my consciousness.
TrainSen	00010	 I am always looking forward to what I will be, what I could possibly become, my intellect, my insight, my ambition, the materialization of all my passions.
TrainSen	00010	 And it fills me with great anxiety, dread that the person inside of my my never emerge.
TrainSen	00010	 And I think back to my early life.
TrainSen	00010	 My parents.
TrainSen	00010	 Childhood.
TrainSen	00010	 When everything rested on today, on that ice cream cone after enduring an afternoon of chores, on that TV show that I've waited for all night.
TrainSen	00010	 These were simple pleasures, now caught up in the mad flood of responsibility and maturation.
TrainSen	00010	 It makes me so tired to look forward.
TrainSen	00010	 To never be now.
TrainSen	00010	 My parents were demanding.
TrainSen	00010	 Good grades, a clean room, church attendance, moral infallibility.
TrainSen	00010	 Always left behind in someone's expectations.
TrainSen	00010	 Enslaved to your own dedication and attachment.
TrainSen	00010	 I loved them then.
TrainSen	00010	 Cherished them.
TrainSen	00010	 Everything I did was to attain their approval.
TrainSen	00010	 Then I would dismiss any pleasure if only for a few words of gratitude or a compliment.
TrainSen	00010	 An ovation of some sort.
TrainSen	00010	 I need approval.
TrainSen	00010	 I still do.
TrainSen	00010	 My father was a loner, and now I am a hermit as well.
TrainSen	00010	 He never shared his thoughts.
TrainSen	00010	 Compassion, empathy, conversation, all foreign in the house.
TrainSen	00010	 I made up games to express myself.
TrainSen	00010	 My imagination was as abundant as the grown-up books I read.
TrainSen	00010	 The stuff everyone else hated.
TrainSen	00010	 The big thick books on science, philosophy and religion.
TrainSen	00010	 When people were still learning their multiplication tables.
TrainSen	00010	 Science fiction.
TrainSen	00010	 Fantasy.
TrainSen	00010	 Anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable.
TrainSen	00010	 And I wanted to escape.
TrainSen	00010	 Straight A's, top of all my classes, and only a pat on the back.
TrainSen	00010	 Still not good enough, because no one would share it.
TrainSen	00010	 They wanted to play outside, go to the bayou, ride bikes, play in puddles, watch a movie, go to a party, raise hell.
TrainSen	00010	 I just wanted to be alone.
TrainSen	00010	 With my books.
TrainSen	00010	 My imagination.
TrainSen	00010	 And I've never had a close friend, because I was always so afraid of betrayal.
TrainSen	00010	 So afraid that I would be cast out, and many times I was, when I just wanted to think.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I don't know if there is much else than my own thoughts, and there is nothing for them to do but bounce around in my head.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope for someone who can share my mind.
TrainSen	00010	 Someone who can relate to life, looking back on it, reflecting, not just living it.
TrainSen	00001	Right now I am thinking about the convocation I have in about 45 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 But I'll definitely need to leave in around thirty.
TrainSen	00001	 that boy Michael was really cute.
TrainSen	00001	 really cute.
TrainSen	00001	 he is the first nice looking Mexican that I have seen yet.
TrainSen	00001	 Ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself.
TrainSen	00001	 that's one of the things I don't like about this school.
TrainSen	00001	 no one introduces themselves to each other.
TrainSen	00001	 it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's.
TrainSen	00001	 but you know what.
TrainSen	00001	 I think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else.
TrainSen	00001	 it's very sad I think.
TrainSen	00001	 at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person.
TrainSen	00001	 Now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral.
TrainSen	00001	 just because we all fear a little bit of rejection.
TrainSen	00001	 Sad really.
TrainSen	00001	 that was my friend matt from economics class.
TrainSen	00001	 He's not really my friend but I sit next to him in class.
TrainSen	00001	 he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm going to be so behind in economics.
TrainSen	00001	 I tell you.
TrainSen	00001	 I really like that class though.
TrainSen	00001	 so anyways.
TrainSen	00001	 I know how this goes because I thought everyone would be nice and friendly but I was met with blank stares when I smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few.
TrainSen	00001	 A very few.
TrainSen	00001	 whatever.
TrainSen	00001	 I am still going to smile and I am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise I will be miserable and unapproachable like those people.
TrainSen	00001	 ugh.
TrainSen	00001	 I just put ""so anyways"" instead of ""so anyway"" I think that sounds as dumb as ""laters"" when one really means ""later"".
TrainSen	00001	 that is really very jr.
TrainSen	00001	 high.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss those days.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder how Cindy is doing.
TrainSen	00001	 ugh.
TrainSen	00001	 I really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and I will be an outcast once again.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart.
TrainSen	00001	 Damn that sounds really conceited.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I'm a little of that too.
TrainSen	00001	 I considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but I think that's pretty dumb considering I really do think those things about myself.
TrainSen	00001	 it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself.
TrainSen	00001	 It's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself.
TrainSen	00001	 I confess that I too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty.
TrainSen	00001	 But if you know it about yourself I think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it.
TrainSen	00001	 Within reason that is.
TrainSen	00001	 so anyway.
TrainSen	00001	 I am these things but I feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore I get shafted.
TrainSen	00001	 I know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting.
TrainSen	00001	 kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely.
TrainSen	00001	 I am so proud of myself lately.
TrainSen	00001	 I am being such a good girl.
TrainSen	00001	 Although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at Trudy's which was pointless to attempt because I missed it anyway.
TrainSen	00001	 I should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp.
TrainSen	00001	 when they are unimportant.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm really irritated by that.
TrainSen	00001	 but back to the story.
TrainSen	00001	 I have been developing such good habits.
TrainSen	00001	 I make my bed everyday, I wash my face twice a day, I get all my assignments down early or at least I begin them really early.
TrainSen	00001	 O shit.
TrainSen	00001	 I just got a little flash of procrastination.
TrainSen	00001	 That sneaky devil.
TrainSen	00001	 NO GO AWAY!!!.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not going to be a procrastinator this year.
TrainSen	00001	 I just don't have the time for that.
TrainSen	00001	 I run every day .
TrainSen	00001	 Mon-thurs.
TrainSen	00001	 2 miles a day.
TrainSen	00001	 plus I see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice.
TrainSen	00001	 kind of a motivating factor.
TrainSen	00001	 when I get back from the convocation I'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up.
TrainSen	00001	 Damn that dinner.
TrainSen	00001	 UGH.
TrainSen	00001	 What else do I do.
TrainSen	00001	 O yea.
TrainSen	00001	 I didn't even go out last weekend and I had no desire too.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't been drinking.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't been too flakey.
TrainSen	00001	 With the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyway we are good terms at the present.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm being a pretty good daughter.
TrainSen	00001	 I finished my scholarship applications stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 what to write about now.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to write about something cool.
TrainSen	00001	 No luck.
TrainSen	00001	 I really want to join the p2 chamber music group but I hope that they allow flutes.
TrainSen	00001	 Bad flutes in lol.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm probably really bad by now.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if there is practice rooms around.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you.
TrainSen	00001	 And then I would act all shy and innocent.
TrainSen	00001	 It's just how I act.
TrainSen	00001	 Natural reflex to wanted attention.
TrainSen	00001	 Sometimes I think I'm so stupid.
TrainSen	00001	 And then they would flatter me and ask me out.
TrainSen	00001	 And I would act like I wasn't really sure.
TrainSen	00001	 I little bit suspicious of their motives.
TrainSen	00001	 (and rightly so I imagine) and then I would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely.
TrainSen	00001	 well I have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away.
TrainSen	00001	 see yaw.
TrainSen	00001	 This has been a pleasant venting experience I tell you.
TrainSen	00010	I really need to study for chemistry, but I just remembered that this assignment was due.
TrainSen	00010	 I  would have done it earlier, but my computer has been giving me so many problems.
TrainSen	00010	 First  all these warnings about ""you have spyware and adware"" started coming up and then it started  working really slow--it took 15 minutes to open up the internet!!  Then after a while it wouldn't  even do that--it just sat there!  So I tried to shut it down and it still didn't do anything--but if I  tried to start a program, it said ""This program cannot open because the system is shutting  down.
TrainSen	00010	 ""  So I unplugged it and let the battery run out.
TrainSen	00010	 Computers are so stupid.
TrainSen	00010	 But I guess we  couldn't live without them.
TrainSen	00010	 I really hope I don't fail this chemistry test tomorrow.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm really  nervous because it's my first real college test and it's also over some stuff that I don't  completely understand.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate is in the same class as me, but she's at the PCL--she  calls it her home because she's there every minute of every day--I don't know how she does it!!  Studying for 10 minutes makes me feel like I need a break--she stays there for hours!!  She's  really sweet though.
TrainSen	00010	 I so happy I got good roommates (yes--that's plural--I have 3  roommates--I'm in supplemental housing--it's not as bad as I thought it would be)  2 of my  roommates are really nice.
TrainSen	00010	 The other one is kind of weird, but she's hardly ever here--she's  always at her boyfriend's house.
TrainSen	00010	 That's kind of rude to her parents though--I mean--they're  paying for her food and housing and she's not even sleeping here.
TrainSen	00010	 The only thing I know about  her is her name really.
TrainSen	00010	 That's okay though--at least she's not using my computer all the time  anymore.
TrainSen	00010	 When we first moved in she didn't have a Ethernet cord so I said she could do her  add/drops on my pc.
TrainSen	00010	 But then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes (on MY  printer--with MY ink) so at least that's not happening any more.
TrainSen	00010	 Andy Roddick lost in the quarterfinals of the US Open tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 That made me so sad--I LOVE  Andy Roddick--he has to be the sexiest guy ever!  I met him last year and the Tennis Masters  Series in Houston and he signed my shirt--me and 3 of my friends had made shirts that spelled  out ANDY--he and his coach really liked them!!  But I really wanted him to win--he won the  Open last year and that was his first so I really wanted him to defend it.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00010	 The guy he  lost to was playing really good.
TrainSen	00010	 He played the same type of game as Andy though.
TrainSen	00010	 They were  calling him a Swedish Andy Roddick, but he'll never be Andy Roddick--he wasn't cute enough.
TrainSen	00010	 Chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not really sure if I want to  major in biology any more.
TrainSen	00010	 I think it might just be too much science for me.
TrainSen	00010	 I thought I could  handle it, but I just don't know anymore.
TrainSen	00010	 I know majoring in biology will probably help me  make a good score on the MCAT, though.
TrainSen	00010	 I really want to get into med school.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to be a  pediatrician.
TrainSen	00010	 It's just so much school though.
TrainSen	00010	 OY!  But I think it'll pay off.
TrainSen	00010	 I really want to do  something with kids and I could do that and make money at the same time.
TrainSen	00010	 I mean--it's that or  teaching right?  and teaching is definitely NOT on my list of things I want to do.
TrainSen	00010	 My mom is a  teacher and they don't get paid half of what they deserve!  She works all the time--sometimes  she doesn't come home until after midnight--and she only works with 5th and 6th graders.
TrainSen	00010	 I  mean--it's probably worse with older kids right?  I don't know--I just couldn't handle it--I'd  feel like I deserved more.
TrainSen	00010	 Chemistry time.
TrainSen	00100	Wow, Its the end of another week ,and finally I get time to relax .
TrainSen	00100	 My idea of relaxing isn't partying or drinking.
TrainSen	00100	 My idea of relaxing is sleeping.
TrainSen	00100	 Yes sleeping for long hours with nothing on my mind, is my favorite hobby.
TrainSen	00100	 My roommate is reading what I'm reading so I had to halt before I continued typing.
TrainSen	00100	 There's another friend in my room and he's laughing at what I just wrote.
TrainSen	00100	 He shouldn't be reading other people's thoughts! Wow 3 minutes over already.
TrainSen	00100	 I got 17 minutes left .
TrainSen	00100	 I'm just feeling really light right now.
TrainSen	00100	 Light in the head.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't think of anything to write.
TrainSen	00100	 This is supposed to be a spontaneous writing assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 It's definitely better than the other assignments where you have to prepare drafts and correct mistakes over and over again.
TrainSen	00100	 Tomorrow's Saturday and Saturday means another football game for UT.
TrainSen	00100	 I couldn't go for the first game, because I didn't have the football package and the tickets cost a lot out of the package.
TrainSen	00100	 My roommate is making me listen to one of her songs right now.
TrainSen	00100	 So basically I'm doing two things at a time-typing and listening to music.
TrainSen	00100	 Some people can study with music playing, I still haven't tried studying with music playing in the background.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I should try it out sometime.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it is important to knock before you enter a room.
TrainSen	00100	 But that just doesn't happen in Jester.
TrainSen	00100	 One of my friends just barged in, and I jumped in my seat.
TrainSen	00100	 This is crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 I should tell him not to do that again.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not that fastidious actually.
TrainSen	00100	 But certain things annoy me.
TrainSen	00100	 The things that would annoy me would actually annoy any normal human being, so I know I'm not a freak.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to call my mom tonight and tell her about the week's events.
TrainSen	00100	 It's been a great week.
TrainSen	00100	 My chemistry test went well.
TrainSen	00100	 I really want to maintain high grades throughout the semester, so I can get some kind of scholarship.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't want my father to pay so much for my education.
TrainSen	00100	 He doesn't grumble or anything, but I just feel guilty.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that I have to work extra hard because I have been given a wonderful opportunity to study in a great school like Stand I must make good use of this advantage I have over other people.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm loving it here.
TrainSen	00100	 I came to America exactly a month ago.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow I should be celebrating today.
TrainSen	00100	 It's been a month in the United States.
TrainSen	00100	 This stupid friend is irritating me, Wish I could ask him to leave, I can't concentrate on my thoughts.
TrainSen	00100	 He's asking me why I type with just two fingers.
TrainSen	00100	 God.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm going to tell him to mind his own business.
TrainSen	00100	 I better change the topic .
TrainSen	00100	 Or he might read this ,and get annoyed and abuse me or something.
TrainSen	00100	 Yeah but making friends has been tough.
TrainSen	00100	 I haven't made too many friends.
TrainSen	00100	 My roommate is my best friend  as of now.
TrainSen	00100	 I couldn't have asked for a better roommate.
TrainSen	00100	 We just get along really well.
TrainSen	00100	 Today at Chemistry class I met another Indian girl.
TrainSen	00100	 She was from Houston .
TrainSen	00100	 She was basically an ABCD -American born confused Desk.
TrainSen	00100	 Desk refers to Indians Ok my 20 minutes are up so I'm going to sign off now.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm going shopping with my friend Rashmi, right now.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm going to the Target store.
TrainSen	00100	 Then I've got to come back and do my laundry.
TrainSen	00100	 Ok.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm going.
TrainSen	00100	 Bye.
TrainSen	00100	 Writing this assignment has been great.
TrainSen	00001	Well, I suppose I should think of a topic to write for 20 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 It is a mystery to what kind of issue or topic the professor wishes me to explore.
TrainSen	00001	 I know he says to just type what I think, but the topic is so broad there are an infinite number of paths and possibilities to explore.
TrainSen	00001	 What exactly is the professor trying to look for in this writing experiment.
TrainSen	00001	 It can't be the simple fact to see if a person is capable of typing for 20 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 My mind currently draws a blank at what I should write about.
TrainSen	00001	 Perhaps my first impressions of college as a freshman? Well so far, I think I'm still getting used to the fact that I am living on my own, and I do have a greater sense of independence from my parents.
TrainSen	00001	 However, there are responsibilities I like and dislike having.
TrainSen	00001	 Wow, it's only been around 5 minutes since I started.
TrainSen	00001	 I really doubt I am capable of typing about no specific topic for a whole 20 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I am thinking if I am required to type for the whole 20 minutes, or if I can simply hit the finish button when I have finished this stream of thought.
TrainSen	00001	 Earlier, I started to complete a few experiment requirements.
TrainSen	00001	 The prescreening requirement was not available, which is kind of depressing since it seemed like an easy 1.
TrainSen	00001	 5 hr worth of experimental credit.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope it becomes available later.
TrainSen	00001	 Now, my mind continues to draw a blank with nothing to write about.
TrainSen	00001	 Honestly, I'm watching TV while typing this assignment, hoping to pass the time a little faster.
TrainSen	00001	 It doesn't seem to be helping much though.
TrainSen	00001	 It's strange when you try to force yourself to type about anything, nothing comes out.
TrainSen	00001	 Not just nothing good, but ABSOLUTELY nothing! Well I'm nearing the 15 min mark, and I seem to have less and less to write.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder how long other people's assignments will be.
TrainSen	00001	 Perhaps most will be longer than mine, but maybe not.
TrainSen	00001	 Some soul must be just as stuck as I am.
TrainSen	01000	I'm glad I'm doing this assignment right now, I can't wait until Friday so I can get hammered That's the guy that was eying me like I was going to steal something it's kind of hot outside I wonder if I should change before we go to Bennigins tonight.
TrainSen	01000	 Did I spell Bennigan's right?  I hope I did the second time.
TrainSen	01000	 Young Buck is a good lyricist.
TrainSen	01000	 It's too bad he doesn't get that much shine.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I'm going to get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome from all this typing.
TrainSen	01000	 General, I salute.
TrainSen	01000	 Lloyd Banks is good too.
TrainSen	01000	 Damn, It's already seven o'clock and I'm just barely getting started on homework!  This running nose sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 I picked a hell of a time to do this.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know why I get sick so often.
TrainSen	01000	 I'd be great if I had health insurance.
TrainSen	01000	 Why is that fool looking at me like that.
TrainSen	01000	 What does he think I'm going to do?  He just doesn't know.
TrainSen	01000	 Damn my muscles are so sore and I'm so tired.
TrainSen	01000	 I got a good workout today.
TrainSen	01000	 I like to reflect on my day towards the end, It's just what I do.
TrainSen	01000	 Shit what the fuck do I do now?  I lost track, but now I'm back on track like a train.
TrainSen	01000	 The Little Engine that Could is what you COULD call me.
TrainSen	01000	 LOL that was so lame!  Why is Ben laughing?  I don't why I'm writing the dumbest shit.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm pretty smart.
TrainSen	01000	 I must be, I got into UT.
TrainSen	01000	 Hook 'Them Horns!  Get off the phone!  Stop talking.
TrainSen	01000	 What's up?  What's up?  What's Up?  Martin!   They don't know me up in here.
TrainSen	01000	 Who do you love?  I love myself.
TrainSen	01000	 I got sunshine on a cloudy day, when It's cold outside, I got the month of May.
TrainSen	01000	 Too bad it's on September.
TrainSen	01000	 Just two more weeks and I turn 20.
TrainSen	01000	 That's going to be crunch, yaw know.
TrainSen	01000	 Hell yeah!  My nose is stopping to run.
TrainSen	01000	 There are a lot of hot girls in my Psych class.
TrainSen	01000	 Shit, there better be, there's fucking 500 plus people in that class.
TrainSen	01000	 Why do people look at me funny.
TrainSen	01000	 I think it's the way I dress.
TrainSen	01000	 Just thuggin it up.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh hold up dog, you better let me in.
TrainSen	01000	 Fuck that let's get in started come on, let's begin.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't even know what to say next.
TrainSen	01000	 I smoke everyday because I stay stressed.
TrainSen	01000	 And stay dressed, fly fresh to death, head to toe until the day I rest.
TrainSen	01000	 Just give me some air forces and fitted hat to match matter of fact give me two of those with a white new era, now who dares to.
TrainSen	01000	 Even approach me.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm known in the ATX, but in H-Town it's locally, express myself vocally cause I fight with words I ain't the one wild in out stay tight on curbs swerve right in burb, high like them birds.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm feeling kind of lucky, you could call me Larry, you call me anything.
TrainSen	01000	 Homie I don't ball with jokes so you could me anything, just don't call me broke.
TrainSen	00010	Hi, I'm sitting here in the computer lab at the FAC, and it is dark outside and I'm a young attractive female.
TrainSen	00010	 .
TrainSen	00010	 I'll definitely need an escort when it's time to go home.
TrainSen	00010	 Home, that's what I call my dorm these days.
TrainSen	00010	 it's just easier for me.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to have some established place to live and stuff that way I'll be more plugged in to the university lifestyle.
TrainSen	00010	 I used to laugh at LT when she called her dorm home.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess I am following in her footsteps.
TrainSen	00010	 although her strides are quite different from mine.
TrainSen	00010	 and talking of strides, I miss cross country and all the guys.
TrainSen	00010	 it was so much fun.
TrainSen	00010	 I enjoyed every moment of it without even knowing it.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I could rewind back to those days when everything was so nice, so quarantined and all the laws of nature followed as they should.
TrainSen	00010	 what went up came down and so on.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I could just see the fruit of my hard work as I did in cross country.
TrainSen	00010	 the family atmosphere that I ridiculed and even took for granted at times.
TrainSen	00010	 how could I have been so? I who loves others, I who cherishes all my friends.
TrainSen	00010	 they were all my friends, all 23 of them.
TrainSen	00010	 some more than others, but we all had that common goal that I find characterizes friendships.
TrainSen	00010	 we were a sister hood.
TrainSen	00010	 gosh, what a mourner I am, lamenting over the past.
TrainSen	00010	 but they were good times.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm sure, and I hope to God that I'll have some more good times or even better than ever times still to come.
TrainSen	00010	 but this I can only hope that God gives me.
TrainSen	00010	 For who knows tomorrow may never be.
TrainSen	00010	 perhaps this is all I have.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not afraid though, just not prepared to meet my maker yet.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think I've done what I was purposed to do.
TrainSen	00010	 therefore I'm not ready to go yet.
TrainSen	00010	 in fact,,, I don't even know what it is that I was purposed to do.
TrainSen	00010	 perhaps it is not a single great thing, perhaps it is just all those little things that I should be doing that I was purposed to do.
TrainSen	00010	 who knows?  who cares but me and my maker?  Anyway, I guess that's life, not figuring out what one was purposed to do but just doing it.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess it just comes naturally as all things in life do.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think planning is such a great idea.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think MLK planned to lead the civil rights movement when he was a freshman in college.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess the civil rights found him and appointed him leader.
TrainSen	00010	 or so I guess.
TrainSen	00010	 and whatever it is that I'll need to do will find me and use me for what I am worth.
TrainSen	00010	 when put that way, it sounds almost prostitution.
TrainSen	00010	 but it cannot be.
TrainSen	00010	 mankind is not a prostitute race.
TrainSen	00010	 or is it.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know.
TrainSen	00010	 sometimes I think it is .
TrainSen	00010	 other times I think it is a dignified race.
TrainSen	00010	 but then again to think mankind a dignified race is to give it too much adoration.
TrainSen	00010	 too much more than it deserves.
TrainSen	00010	 Mankind is a fallen race.
TrainSen	00010	 lower than the angles -which we should have been higher than.
TrainSen	00010	 but then again mankind is a dignified race made in the image of God with the ability to tap into the supernatural/the unknown unlike any other creature.
TrainSen	00010	 There is no intelligent life in other planets, we are it.
TrainSen	00010	 Now, I don't mean to say there is no other life forms out there, but that it is not more intelligent or even as intelligent as mankind.
TrainSen	00010	 but then again what do I know? I who was born only 18 years ago?  I don't know much, but then again, I have know a lot more than I credit myself.
TrainSen	00010	 I have the ability to tap into the fountain of knowledge that never runs dry.
TrainSen	00010	 there are things, great mysteries, that I knew even before I was born.
TrainSen	00010	 but how is this?.
TrainSen	01000	well I'm sitting in the library doing the writing assignment for psychology class.
TrainSen	01000	 This is really fun.
TrainSen	01000	 I just finished writing down my notes for astronomy class because I have a quiz in there on Thursday.
TrainSen	01000	 I went home this past weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 Nothing really exciting happened.
TrainSen	01000	 I visited with my family for memorial day.
TrainSen	01000	 My cousin was nominated for homecoming queen.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow.
TrainSen	01000	 Not.
TrainSen	01000	 Anyway yeah.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm back now.
TrainSen	01000	 It was weird having to pack to go home.
TrainSen	01000	 I saw a movie over the weekend, wicker park was the name of it.
TrainSen	01000	 It was really good.
TrainSen	01000	 I thought that it wasn't going to be that good but I really liked it, it was a love story and I'm always a sucker for those.
TrainSen	01000	 well the time is going by really slowly.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to get back to my room so I can watch my favorite TV show of all time.
TrainSen	01000	 Big brother.
TrainSen	01000	 it's almost over so it's getting exciting.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't think I spelled that right.
TrainSen	01000	 O well.
TrainSen	01000	 This is the easiest assignment I think that I've ever been assigned.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow.
TrainSen	01000	 20 min is a really long time.
TrainSen	01000	 I still have 15 more minutes to go.
TrainSen	01000	 ummm.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been in the library a really long time.
TrainSen	01000	 And I still need to finish the pre-screening survey for this class so I can get experiment credit.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm really tired.
TrainSen	01000	 My friend Jennifer is sitting next to me.
TrainSen	01000	 She already did the assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I was in my bed right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm always tired these days.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm liking college so far.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss home sometimes and it seems like I miss it at the weirdest times but I think I'm adjusting pretty well.
TrainSen	01000	 At least I think so.
TrainSen	01000	 I left my medicine at home so I'm having trouble breathing.
TrainSen	01000	 But my mom is sending it to me so I can feel better soon.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to go to a UT football game for an assignment in my freshman seminar class but I didn't buy a sports package which by the way I think is the stupidest think I've ever heard of.
TrainSen	01000	 I think if you're a student then you should be able to get into the game for free but what do I know.
TrainSen	01000	 Anyway so I need to find somebody with an extra ticket that they want to give me.
TrainSen	01000	 um I like all my professors except my freshman seminar prof.
TrainSen	01000	 He picks on me because I'm quiet and I don't talk much.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate when teachers do that.
TrainSen	01000	 It really bugs me .
TrainSen	01000	 I like listening to people talk.
TrainSen	01000	 O man I still have 8 min to go.
TrainSen	01000	 Blah blah.
TrainSen	01000	 um a little while ago this guy was sitting next to me and he kept farting.
TrainSen	01000	 It smelt so bad.
TrainSen	01000	 Luckily he left because I don't think I would have been able to take it much longer.
TrainSen	01000	 well now I can't think of anything to write so maybe I'll sing a song.
TrainSen	01000	 ""on Monday I'm waiting, Tuesday I'm fading and by Wednesday I can't sleep.
TrainSen	01000	 Then the phone rings I hear you and the darkness is a clear view because you've come to rescue me"".
TrainSen	01000	 That was Ashley Simpson.
TrainSen	01000	 I like her because she has the same name as me even though she doesn't spell it the right way.
TrainSen	01000	 That's ok I guess I can forgive her.
TrainSen	01000	 I like her sister, Jessica, too even if she is a dumb blond sometimes but at least she's herself unlike so many other people I know that try to copy what other people do and they can't come up with a unique thought if their live depended on it.
TrainSen	01000	 Well I only have 3 minutes left.
TrainSen	01000	 Thank goodness.
TrainSen	01000	 It seems like I've been typing forever.
TrainSen	01000	 Well my hand are getting tired of typing and I keep misspelling stuff so I have to keep on pressing the backspace button and I'm really tired.
TrainSen	01000	 I've already said that but that's all I can think of right now.
TrainSen	01000	 My eyes keep wanting to close.
TrainSen	01000	 Good only one more minute and then I'm going to go and take a nap.
TrainSen	01000	 O wait I can't.
TrainSen	01000	 I have too much reading to do.
TrainSen	01000	 That's all I do these days is read, read, read, and then I read some more.
TrainSen	01000	WELL, I FINALLY GOT TO MY WRITING FOR PSY.
TrainSen	01000	 I HAVE BEEN AT HOME DURING THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND.
TrainSen	01000	 I MISSED MY FAMILY SO MUCH ESPECIALLY MY DOG MENO.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE.
TrainSen	01000	 I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW.
TrainSen	01000	 I HAVE TODAY OFF.
TrainSen	01000	 MY CLASS IS NOT UNTIL 3:30 PM AND THE CLASS IS BIO 212.
TrainSen	01000	      MY BIO 212 PROFESSOR IS PRETTY FUNNY EVENTHOUGH I ONLY UNDERSTAND HIM HALF OF THE TIME.
TrainSen	01000	 THE FUNNY THING IS HE LECTURES BETTER THAN MY BIO 211 PROFESSOR.
TrainSen	01000	 MY BIO 211 PROFESSOR REALLY CANNOT LECTURE AT ALL.
TrainSen	01000	 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND HIM OR ELSE MY EXAMS WILL BE EXTREMELY HORRIBLE.
TrainSen	01000	 I HAVE A HUGE HEADACHE RIGHT NOW.
TrainSen	01000	      I'M WATCHING SOAPS RIGHT NOW.
TrainSen	01000	 I'M WAITING TO WATCH ALL MY CHILDREN.
TrainSen	01000	 RIGHT NOW I'M WATCHING PORT CHARLES WHICH BROKE OFF OF GENERAL HOSPITAL.
TrainSen	01000	 RIGHT NOW ALISON IS LOCKED IN JAIL.
TrainSen	01000	 EVERYONE THINKS SHE KILLED HER BEST FRIEND FATHER BUT IN REALITY SHE REALLY DIDN'T.
TrainSen	01000	 ALISON IS A PERSON THAT IS SWEET AND INNOCENT AND CAN NEVER KILL ANYONE.
TrainSen	01000	 THE PERSON THAT REALLY KILLED OR HURT ALISON'S BEST FRIEND LIVIE IS A WOMAN THAT DIED 300 YEARS AGO.
TrainSen	01000	 SHE HAS BLACK MAGIC.
TrainSen	01000	 SHE CAME OUT OF THE PICTURE.
TrainSen	01000	 IT IS REALLY FUNNY.
TrainSen	01000	 KNOW WONDER THIS SHOW WAS CUT OFF OF ABC.
TrainSen	01000	 IT'S ABOUT MAGIC AND VAMPIRES.
TrainSen	01000	      WOW I CAN'T BELIEVER I HAVE ONLY BEEN WRITING FOR 9 MINUTES.
TrainSen	01000	 20 MINUTES FEEL SO FAR AWAY.
TrainSen	01000	 I JUST SIGNED UP FOR THE PRESCREENING SURVEY.
TrainSen	01000	 I WONDER HOW THAT WORKS.
TrainSen	01000	       YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GONE SHOPPING IN A LONG TIME.
TrainSen	01000	 I MISS IT.
TrainSen	01000	 THE MALL DOWN HERE REALLY SMELLS AND IS PRETTY OLD BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE STORES I LIKE.
TrainSen	01000	 LIKE BEBE, BEBE SPORT, WHITE HOUSE AND BLACK MARKET, NORDSTROM.
TrainSen	01000	 I MISS MY GALLERIA IN DALLAS.
TrainSen	01000	 I USUALLY GO SHOPPING ONCE A WEEK BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN A MONTH SINCE I HAVE GONE.
TrainSen	01000	       I CAN'T BELIEVE MY BROTHER IS STILL SLEEPING IT IS LIKE ALMOST 12 IN THE AFTERNOON.
TrainSen	01000	       SPEAKING OF MY BROTHER.
TrainSen	01000	 HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF OF COURSE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE CAREER LAST NIGHT.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF PHARMACY IS REALLY THE WAY I WANT TO GO.
TrainSen	01000	 I LIKE IT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THAT LONG AND IT MAKES GOOD MONEY, BUT I DON'T KOW IF I REALLY AM GOING TO ENJOY IT.
TrainSen	01000	 I WISH I COULD FIND SOMETHING IN UT THAT WOULD POP OUT AT ME.
TrainSen	01000	 I WANT A CAREER THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY AND MAKE GOOD MONEY.
TrainSen	01000	 I WISH I HAD A DREAM THAT WOULD TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT I WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE.
TrainSen	01000	 I WISH GOD WOULD COME INTO MY DREAM AND TELL ME THAT THIS IS THE PATH YOU ARE TAKING TO THE FUTURE.
TrainSen	01000	 WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE TO KNOW.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH TO MY FUTURE.
TrainSen	01000	 I DON'T WANT TO WASTE HALF OF MY LIFE ON SOMETHING I WILL HATE IN THE FUTURE.
TrainSen	01000	 HOPEFULLY SOMETHING WILL TRIGGER ME SOON.
TrainSen	01000	        I AM STILL WATCHING SOAPS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES ALL MY CHILDREN WILL BE ON.
TrainSen	01000	 WOW I ONLY HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT TO WRITE.
TrainSen	01000	 I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD SO MUCH TO SAY.
TrainSen	01000	 IT REALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER JUST TO SAY EVERYTHING ON MY MIND.
TrainSen	00010	There's a picture of the two of us up on my bulletin board.
TrainSen	00010	 It's right behind my computer where I can see it when I'm working.
TrainSen	00010	 I look at that picture and remember my past.
TrainSen	00010	 I remember a time when I thought that things were different than they really are.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think anymore that it was anyone's fault, either hers or mine, that is.
TrainSen	00010	 I respected her so much though, and it hurts to be let down by someone you think so highly of.
TrainSen	00010	 In the picture, I look so innocent and young, in my white cheerleading skirt, and the royal blue shell with Eagles written across it.
TrainSen	00010	 Her arm is around my shoulder, and she's holding her sunglasses in her hand.
TrainSen	00010	 I recall that she had just taken them off before we took the picture.
TrainSen	00010	 There are people in the background behind us, and the gym is visible.
TrainSen	00010	 I remember how beautiful the day was; it was so crisp and blue and wonderful.
TrainSen	00010	 It's hard to tell, and I've wondered many times, what exactly she was thinking when we took that picture together.
TrainSen	00010	 When I look at the face, the eyes especially, sometimes I see something warm and trustworthy.
TrainSen	00010	 Other times I'm sure I see something sinister and strange.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why I still struggle with this issue so much.
TrainSen	00010	 I've never really gotten over it.
TrainSen	00010	 I went into this assignment knowing that I wanted to write about Carla because in class, I heard something said about how writing about something can change your opinion or the way you look at something.
TrainSen	00010	 Well, it is true that I'm noticing things about the picture, minute details, that I didn't pay too much attention to before.
TrainSen	00010	 But her face and her eyes are still an enigma to me.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't explain in words how much I want her to care about me, to love me, and to think I'm something special.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to tell her everything that I've done today and yesterday and since I arrived here.
TrainSen	00010	 But she's back home, and I'm here, and there's something ominous to me about writing her an email.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss her so much.
TrainSen	00010	 She was there when I really needed someone.
TrainSen	00010	 I see now more and more, that this was mostly situational.
TrainSen	00010	 It's not like she planned to be in that room when my whole world fell apart.
TrainSen	00010	 But she was.
TrainSen	00010	 And she told me how to get through it, and she cared.
TrainSen	00010	 More than any person has ever cared about me on this earth, at least that I'm aware of.
TrainSen	00010	 The picture is truly beautiful, even though it's more than 5 years old.
TrainSen	00010	 The light is in our hair, coming from behind, and our faces are bright and illuminated.
TrainSen	00010	 The beauty of the day is apparent.
TrainSen	00010	 I just feel like something needs to happen between us.
TrainSen	00010	 There was never any closure for me, or continuation.
TrainSen	00010	 Our relationship just sort of drifted off and never returned, and now I don't know where we are.
TrainSen	00010	 I saw her by chance before I left for college at church because we are making a new church pictorial, and her family happened to be getting their pictures done on the same night as our family.
TrainSen	00010	 I was very surprised to see her, and I know my heart skipped a beat.
TrainSen	00010	 I hadn't seen her in such a long time.
TrainSen	00010	 probably since before school let out for the summer.
TrainSen	00010	 The truth is, I was a little bit upset with her for not being around.
TrainSen	00010	 But she was nothing but warm and kind to me.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why she always does that.
TrainSen	00010	 I see her, and it's like I'm the whole world.
TrainSen	00010	 But then when we're apart, I don't hear a peep.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't understand our relationship sometimes, and it's very hurtful to me to analyze her possible motives.
TrainSen	00010	 Anyway, she hugged me, and touched me, and stood close to me, and made me promise to keep in touch when I'm gone.
TrainSen	00010	 She even promised to make me some chili or something when I come back and come over to her house.
TrainSen	00010	 I fear that that's an empty promise, like so many of the others.
TrainSen	00010	 But at the time, it was easy to believe her.
TrainSen	00010	 I really think it's something to do with her eyes.
TrainSen	00010	 You have never seen anyone with such power behind their gaze.
TrainSen	00010	 She is so earnest with her eyes, but so untruthful with her actions.
TrainSen	00010	 It confuses me to no end.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't even know why I brought the picture with me, or why I decided to place it in such an obvious place where I can always see it.
TrainSen	00010	 But I did.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess my hopes die hard.
TrainSen	00010	 I still hope that maybe she really does care about me.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe she really does think I'm special.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe, she does even really love me.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know what to believe.
TrainSen	00010	 I think maybe this evening when I have some time to myself, I'll write her that email that I've been meaning to.
TrainSen	00010	 I think maybe I could even get up the courage to be totally honest with her, and get everything out in the open.
TrainSen	00010	 Well, maybe that's a little too unrealistic, but maybe I can begin to open it up for discussion.
TrainSen	00010	 I think it would be very good for me to do so.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to know what's really behind those eyes.
TrainSen	00010	 I've got to know about the truth.
TrainSen	00010	 I really desire to understand the enigma.
TrainSen	00010	 My dear Carla.
TrainSen	10000	Here I sit wondering just what to write that involves my stream of consciousness, which shouldn't be too hard.
TrainSen	10000	 Writing for me is usually pretty easy, however this assignment seems to be particularly hard.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe because I feel partially tired and torn down from my long day.
TrainSen	10000	 I am looking forward to tomorrow because Thursdays are probably my easiest days because I will not have to wake up at the usual 9am and oh yeah it is also one day closer to the weekend!  Although I have to say that 9am is also a lot better than 8am, which was time I had to arrive at school during my high school days.
TrainSen	10000	 Since high school just popped into my mind, I have to say that college is a major leap from high school.
TrainSen	10000	 Despite the fact that it is more enjoyable it also is a lot more stressful.
TrainSen	10000	 For instance, leaving your family, friends, and so forth behind.
TrainSen	10000	 Not to mention your adolescence.
TrainSen	10000	 I am happy to say that the transition for me has ran pretty smoothly although the major bumps are yet to come.
TrainSen	10000	 One of my ""bumps"" that I am experiencing is the massive amount of reading involved, at one point I enjoyed reading but maybe that is because the reading is not usually my preferred choice.
TrainSen	10000	 Another obstacle is that it it is your choice whether to read or not, in fact it is just another realization that I am out in the real world and everything is based upon my choices.
TrainSen	10000	 I find that very scary, yet also very exciting in a positive way because I can make my future what I want it to be.
TrainSen	00001	I am sitting in my room watching the sandlot.
TrainSen	00001	 Alessandra, my roommate is here too.
TrainSen	00001	 She's getting ready to go home for the weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 Shelley and Liz are both going home to.
TrainSen	00001	 They offered me a ride, but I'm not going to go because I went home last weekend, and I don't want to go home two weekends in a row.
TrainSen	00001	 Although I would really like to see Jordan, my boyfriend.
TrainSen	00001	 He's at work right now and I'm waiting for him to call.
TrainSen	00001	 The sandlot is on the part where Benny decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard.
TrainSen	00001	 I've seen this movie a thousand times, the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town.
TrainSen	00001	 This is probably one of my favorite baseball movies.
TrainSen	00001	 My favorite of all time is definitely Field of Dreams.
TrainSen	00001	 I always cry in the end where Kevin Costner's character plays catch with his dad.
TrainSen	00001	 They didn't get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died.
TrainSen	00001	 My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been, I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it, so I'm glad we are at least trying to work things out.
TrainSen	00001	 He apologized to Jordan this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer.
TrainSen	00001	 Jordan came over and they had a talk on the back porch.
TrainSen	00001	 I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing.
TrainSen	00001	 But apparently it went alright.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that.
TrainSen	00001	 I forgot to before.
TrainSen	00001	 Actually, I just realized now that that's something I need to do.
TrainSen	00001	 Probably should have said it earlier.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I didn't hurt his feelings.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well, like I said, I felt awkward about the whole thing in general.
TrainSen	00001	 Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today.
TrainSen	00001	 I was at the Union with Shelley, and I went to the bathroom.
TrainSen	00001	 Another girl was going in just as I was, and this made my shy bladder act up.
TrainSen	00001	 She went into one stall, I went into the other, and I just couldn't go.
TrainSen	00001	 Well, she wasn't going either, apparently, so we both just sat there for about a minute.
TrainSen	00001	 I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little, but then it stopped.
TrainSen	00001	 So the girl pees a little, and I pee a little more, but I still can't go all the way.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess she gave up, because I heard the toilet flush and she left, so I was finally able to go.
TrainSen	00001	 I went back to Shelley and told her the story.
TrainSen	00001	 We were cracking up in the quietness of the Union 3rd floor.
TrainSen	00001	 We started talking about Alex's engagement (again), which I feel guilty about because I am usually not the type to gossip, but it's hard to avoid talking about it.
TrainSen	00001	 Before I saw Alex's ring (which is her grandmothers, Joe did not buy it), Shelley told me that it was 1.
TrainSen	00001	 7 carats, which is pretty impressive, but then I saw it, and looked at it closely, and it's not that great.
TrainSen	00001	 Its color isn't that good, and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which I suppose Alex either hasn't seen or is just pretending that she can't see it.
TrainSen	00001	 Jordan just called and I told him I need to call him back in eight minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyway, Alex is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement, wedding thing.
TrainSen	00001	 She wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring, and she's looking at dresses that are 30,000 dollar, designer dresses, and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding.
TrainSen	00001	 She doesn't seem to realize that the average middle class family can't afford something like that.
TrainSen	00001	 But who knows, maybe her parents have more money than I think.
TrainSen	00001	 Also, I don't know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement.
TrainSen	00001	 She's only been with Joe for about two months.
TrainSen	00001	 I can hardly think about my future with Jordan now, and I definitely couldn't have thought about it after two months.
TrainSen	00001	 The only thing I can say is that if we're still together when I graduate, I'll probably marry him.
TrainSen	00001	 But I find myself thinking a lot that I want to be single, and I want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in New York, and if someone is going to hold me back from those things, then I have to wonder if that's the person from me.
TrainSen	00001	 I love him so much, but I also feel like I might be holding on to him because he's my first love and all that.
TrainSen	00001	 He's such a great person though, I hope no matter what happens, that he will always be in my life.
TrainSen	00001	 I just don't want to break his heart, or have my heart broken.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope when it stops working, it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends.
TrainSen	00001	 Well, I have ten seconds left, so I think I'm going to call him now.
TrainSen	01000	At 855 I should be done writing this paper!!! I am so excited that I get to go home and see my man today.
TrainSen	01000	 So my body really hurts right now but I feel great because I have worked out every day for like the past week and now I think I am addicted to working out.
TrainSen	01000	 it gives me such a rush and whoa!!!!! someone just slam their door and it scared the hell out of me.
TrainSen	01000	 I hat when people slam their doors it is so frustrating.
TrainSen	01000	 We have designated quiet hours in the dorm AND THERE THEY GO AGAIN!!! no one ever follows those quiet hours lalalala I really feel like dancing I think it would be cool it is funny how my typing can't keep up with my thoughts so in essence all I can think about it the typing of this paper and how sad it is that I have to do it for 20 minutes which I originally thought would be a short period of time but I look at the clock right now and it says 420 which means it is time to smoke.
TrainSen	01000	 Lol that is if I smoked weed which I don't I actually find that to be so stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 why do you have to smoke or drink anything to feel good about life.
TrainSen	01000	 Sounds like a lame excuse of trying to cover some sort of problem you have.
TrainSen	01000	 psychology is such an interesting major.
TrainSen	01000	 I just got to find a minor for rotc and actually rotc seems, surprisingly, like it will be a lot of fun! I am so ready to prove to myself and to everyone else that I can cut it I just hope I maintain my GPA and can be like what now! I love the idea of pushing myself to achieve something because once I finish it is the best feeling kind of like the ""high"" I get when I exercise I need to call my mom and tell her to pick up some water at that case lot sale I am excited to be going home to see my b/f but I really don't want to see my family that is probably the one thing I don't miss all that arguing I can't wait to graduate from college one thing that scares is me is my relationship with my man.
TrainSen	01000	 he is older I know and I do love him or at list I think I love him and I would never want to hurt him , but I am scared about settling down after college for so many years I saw college as being the perfect time to party and meet boys, but now it isn't like that I LOVE TO FLIRT but I have someone that cares about me and that I care about but I just don't know to I want to settle down with someone that doesn't even have a high school diploma.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm scared he's going to end up using me or something stupid like that.
TrainSen	01000	 I know that is mean but so far he doesn't keep his promises to me and he lies and I pay for EVERYTHING but it doesn't matter he  will pay me $200 I think I have spent over $1000 on our relationship.
TrainSen	01000	 Going out to eat and the movies and just things like that and it sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh well that is life goodness this is the longest 20 minutes of my life I am starting to get typer's cramp.
TrainSen	01000	 Is that possible? well staring at this screen sure isn't helpful at all!! I am so hungry and want to go downstairs and get food but first I have to wait to finish this paper THEN I got to go get my laundry and put it into the dryer so this could take awhile.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder what I'm going to wear I want to wear my brown shoes but do I have anything natural colored to go along with it I have my green shirt my stripped one is dirty hmm I really should look would white go ummm I need to paint my toenails!!! I can so do that when I get back from eating actually I think naw I do them when I get back look only 3 and a half more minutes I think my roommate is back nope someone else I wonder where she is because her class got out at 9 but normally she comes back early.
TrainSen	01000	 I really hope I make the crew team I think that would be so cool.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to make a team And feel special just something else to tell myself that I can do it everyone keeps saying because I am tall but it will be a whole new experience because I know nothing about the sport man I need to brush my teeth what can wear damn I got to remember my list to take home call the court got to ad that to the list so many things to do this weekend I think I'm going to take summer courses yay! almost finished 3.
TrainSen	01000	 2.
TrainSen	01000	I am sitting in my room and I look around to see my roommate and my boyfriend.
TrainSen	01000	 Trying to make my train of thought come to me so I can type it.
TrainSen	01000	 All I can think about is all my boyfriend's theories about life and his many different issues.
TrainSen	01000	 He believes in ""Boxism"", he was a little out of it when he thought of this, were everyone was born in a box which was placed in a bigger box, hospital room, which is part of a bigger box, the hospital hall, which is placed into a bigger box, the whole hospital building itself.
TrainSen	01000	 Then he goes on to state that we are then taken home and put in a box, the crib, which is in a box the room, part of the bigger box the whole house.
TrainSen	01000	 After this we go to school and the classroom becomes our box after we graduate we our placed in our dorm room box and walk from class to class or box to box.
TrainSen	01000	 After we finally manage to get a job our cubicle or office which then becomes our box.
TrainSen	01000	 Then he goes on that when we die they dig a box and put you into a box.
TrainSen	01000	 My boyfriend's theory always brings a smile to my face as I remember when he first told me this.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow, that only took me ten minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 I look around my room and see all my pictures and think about going back to high school, I believe that those are some of the best times in my life.
TrainSen	01000	 My class was very small and we all got to know each other very well.
TrainSen	01000	 I have always been told that college is the best time of you life but it will take a lot to compete with high school.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope it becomes the best time of my life.
TrainSen	01000	 I have already come to enjoy it and have become adapted to college life.
TrainSen	01000	 I love being able to do whatever I want when I want to.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope these next few years will become the best years of my life.
TrainSen	01000	I REALLY ENJOY THIS CLASS.
TrainSen	01000	 I CAN GET INTO IT AND NOT BE BORED LIKE MY OTHER CLASSES.
TrainSen	01000	 THE CLASS THAT I HATE THE MOST IS MY CHEMISTRY CLASS BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TEACHER AND I SONT UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT.
TrainSen	01000	 MY MAJOR IS NURSING AND PRE-MED.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY HOPE I CAN GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL SO I CAN BECOME A SURGEON.
TrainSen	01000	 MY ROOM JUST LEFT TO HER LAB CLASS.
TrainSen	01000	 HER NAME IS KATRINA BUT I CALL HER KAT.
TrainSen	01000	 SHE'S SO AWESOME!! WE BOUGHT A FISH TOGETHER ON MONDAY.
TrainSen	01000	 HIS NAME IS SENIOR SOL.
TrainSen	01000	 OKAY!?! THIS THING JUST WENT BACK SO I CLICKED FORWARD ON THE WEB BROWSER AND MY INFORMATION WAS STILL HERE, BUT MY TIME STARTED OVER SO THAT SUCKS!!! I'M KIND OF WATCHING TV AND DOING THIS ASSIGNMENT AT THE SAME TIME, BUT MOST OF MY FOUCUS IS GOING INTO THIS.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY MISS MY FRIENDS!!! ESPECIALLY THE FAB FIVE!! EMILY, LAURA, MIGUEL, ARON, AND SOID!! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!! I TALKED TO EMILY YESTERDAY ONLINE AND SHE'S ROOMING WITH LAURA AT SMU AND SHE TOLD ME THAT LAURA IS GOING GREEK AND IS STARTING TO ACT LIKE A BARBIE DOLL!! I WONDER IF AS SOON AS I GO HOME IF ME AND HER WILL STILL GET ALONG!!?? HMM.
TrainSen	01000	 WONDERS.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY HAVE TO GO TO THE RESTROOM AND I DON'T THINK I CAN REALLY GET UP AND GO OR IF I HAVE TO KEEP WRITING?? I REALLY HAVE TO GO SO I'M GOING TO GO AND I'LL BE BACK SOON!!!.
TrainSen	01000	 .
TrainSen	01000	 .
TrainSen	01000	 .
TrainSen	01000	 OKAY I'M BACK! I HOPE THAT DOESN'T EFFECT ANYTHING BUT I THINK IT MADE UP FOR THE TIME THAT GOT ERASED.
TrainSen	01000	 I'M WATCHING WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONARE NOW AND I WISH I COULD BE ON THAT SHOW BECAUSE I THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT AND BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO BE ON TV AND MAKE MONEY AS WELL.
TrainSen	01000	 IT'S REALLY COLD IN MY DORM ROOM AND I'M STARTING TO GET SICK.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY MISS MY BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW.
TrainSen	01000	 HE'S AT WORK THOUGH.
TrainSen	01000	 HE GOES TO ACC AND HE'S A SECOND YEAR.
TrainSen	01000	 I THINK IF HE WASN'T HERE IN AUSTIN WITH ME I WOULD GO CRAZY BECAUSE I WOULD BE HERE ALL ALONE WITHOUT FRIENDS OR FAMILY.
TrainSen	01000	 HIS NAME IS REY AND ON THE 14TH.
TrainSen	01000	 ITS GOING TO BE OUR 2 MONTH ANNIVERSARY.
TrainSen	01000	 IT HAS BEEN ONE OF MY LONGEST RELATIONSHIPS.
TrainSen	01000	 MY LONGEST RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE 6 MONTHS AND THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS OFF AND ON.
TrainSen	01000	 THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH MY RELATIONSHIP WITH REY AND THAT IS THAT MY FAMILY STILL DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT HIM AND I THINK I SHOULD TELL THEM SOON.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY LOVE HIM A LOT!! HE TREATS ME RIGHT AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN INTO A FIGHT THAT WE DON'T SPEAK TO EACH OTHER.
TrainSen	01000	 I TALK TO HIM EVERYDAY AND WE TRY TO SEE EACH OTHER EVERYDAY AND SO FAR SINCE I'VE MOVED HERE I DO SEE HIM EVERYDAY EVEN IF ITS JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
TrainSen	01000	 I THINK THAT HE MIGHT BE THE ONE.
TrainSen	01000	 HE TOLD HIS FAMILY ALL ABOUT ME!! AND SO FAR THEY APPROVE.
TrainSen	01000	 ONE OF HIS COUSINS THOUGH SAID THAT SHE IS GOING TO THROW WATER BALLOONS AT ME BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT HIM TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
TrainSen	01000	 I ALSO MISS MY FAMILY A LOT BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM THAT I MISS THEM BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL BE LIKE I TOLD U SO AND I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE GOING TO MISS US.
TrainSen	01000	 MY MOM EMAILS ME AND CALLS ME EVERYDAY.
TrainSen	01000	 EVEN THOUGH ITS NOT NECESSARY SINCE I HAVEN'T LIVED AT HOME SINCE JUNE SINCE I WAS ATTENDING SMU BUT SHE JUST STARTED CALLING EVERYDAY AS SOON AS I MOVED TO AUSTIN.
TrainSen	01000	 MY LITTLE COUSIN JONATHAN THAT I MISS THE MOST AND I CRY EACH TIME JUST THINKING ABOUT HIM IS UPSET AND CRYS FOR ME BECAUSE HE DIDNT WANT ME TO MOVE AND HE NEVER SEEMS TO WANT TO TALK TO ME BECAUSE HE WANTS ME TO GIVE HIM A BETTER REASON THAN SCHOOL FOR ME MOVING.
TrainSen	01000	 BIG BROTHER 5 JUST STARTED AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PROGRAM, BUT A LOT OF THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN THE GAME DISSAPOINT ME BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF BACK-STABBING GOING ON.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY NEED TO READ FOR ME CLASS AND I NEED TO STOP PROCRASTINATING.
TrainSen	01000	 I NEED TO GET ON THE BALL AND START STUDYING OTHER THAN DOING NOTHING AND WATCHING TV AND GOING OUT.
TrainSen	01000	 I REALLY LIKE UT AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I'VE EVER MADE.
TrainSen	00001	This is a very interesting homework assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish the rest of my assignments were this interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 I am a home right now.
TrainSen	00001	 I can home for the weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 It has been two weeks since I left for college and I came home.
TrainSen	00001	 I know it is not recommended to do this but I did.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't think it will affect me.
TrainSen	00001	 The only thing is that I don't want to see my mom cry again.
TrainSen	00001	 That is the worst part.
TrainSen	00001	 I love typing, it is so much easier than writing by hand.
TrainSen	00001	 I have not spoken to my two best friends.
TrainSen	00001	 One of them I am kind of upset at because she is so infatuated with a guy that she blew her two best friends off.
TrainSen	00001	 That really hurt my feelings.
TrainSen	00001	 Wow, only two minutes have gone by.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if I am going to have enough things to write about for twenty minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 Doing the assignment for this class reminds of the class and the cute guys in the class.
TrainSen	00001	 I have so much homework and I started to work on it at noon, but it is chemistry and it was difficult.
TrainSen	00001	 I got very frustrated.
TrainSen	00001	 I also had a lot of distractions.
TrainSen	00001	 For example, I brought home two weeks worth of laundry and I have been doing all the loads since I woke up and had breakfast.
TrainSen	00001	 That was about ten this morning.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what is happening down in Austin.
TrainSen	00001	 It feels weird not to be there, and when I am there, it feels weird not to be there.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what is happening at the Castilian.
TrainSen	00001	 What is laundry boy doing?  Is he doing his laundry again.
TrainSen	00001	 It feels so good to be close to my mom and getting her cooking.
TrainSen	00001	 She is the best cook in the world.
TrainSen	00001	 My sister's birthday is tomorrow and I am glad I got her her present early.
TrainSen	00001	 My mom and dad came home with her presents today and she is really excited.
TrainSen	00001	 My mom gave her her present and it was what she wanted.
TrainSen	00001	 She was given the chance to get dad's present early too, but she decided to wait.
TrainSen	00001	 The big game is about to start and I am contemplating about watching it.
TrainSen	00001	 I really wish I would get around to doing my homework.
TrainSen	00001	 I have been really bad at managing my time lately.
TrainSen	00001	 I checked my loan status and everything has been approved.
TrainSen	00001	 Thank God.
TrainSen	00001	 Yes I will be in debt forever, but right now the important thing is to get an education at the place of my choice.
TrainSen	00001	 I have to pay off debts that are roaming around.
TrainSen	00001	 If I have money left over, I want to buy myself a lap top computer.
TrainSen	00001	 It is so different how everything at UT is so technologically advanced.
TrainSen	00001	 Is that how it is on other campuses.
TrainSen	00001	 The big game is tonight.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if I will ever get around to going to a football game.
TrainSen	00001	 I think maybe for the experience.
TrainSen	00001	 I sister was disgusted by something on TV.
TrainSen	00001	 I can hear the dryer.
TrainSen	00001	 It has been going almost all day.
TrainSen	00001	 I had a lot of clothes to wash.
TrainSen	00001	 How am I going to make time to do laundry.
TrainSen	00001	 I think since I was instructed by mom to wait until I came home, that is why it piled up.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I will do it weekly in Austin.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what Jessica is doing right now?  What is she thinking about the issue?  Does she know what is going on?  I really want to talk to her, but I will not look for her.
TrainSen	00001	 I think it is her responsibility to see what made us feel bad.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I have justifiable reasons to be mad at her.
TrainSen	00001	 Wow, the time is almost up.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought I was going to be dragging this on and on.
TrainSen	00001	 I was just thinking of the ride home yesterday.
TrainSen	00001	 I almost made a driving mistake that could have cost me.
TrainSen	00001	 There were so many cars.
TrainSen	00001	 Since I have not been driving in Austin, it was weird.
TrainSen	00001	 I tried leaving Austin right as the schools had let out and there was a big traffic jam on I-35.
TrainSen	00001	 I was crazy.
TrainSen	00001	 I was just inching along.
TrainSen	00001	 It took me about an hour to make it out of Austin.
TrainSen	00001	 My dad is such a goof ball.
TrainSen	00001	 He was telling me how things are just not the same without me here at home.
TrainSen	00001	 Everyone is really emotional.
TrainSen	00001	 My text books were so expensive.
TrainSen	00001	 I am still blown away by the prices.
TrainSen	00001	 Then yesterday I had to buy a stupid calculator.
TrainSen	00001	 I had a quiz and could not use a graphing one.
TrainSen	00010	I'm tired, I just cleaned our apartment and now I'm tired.
TrainSen	00010	 But I feel satisfied that I cleaned the whole place.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate is extremely messy and is hard to live with at times but I've known her for 15 years and I love her to death.
TrainSen	00010	 Now my mind is being tracked to when we met at the baseball field when pur older brothers were at practice.
TrainSen	00010	 Evan, my brother is now is Africa and I miss him a lot I think it hits me in waves.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what it's like there, hot and rainy I suppose but I wonder if he misses us as much as we miss him.
TrainSen	00010	 I think he probably does he just doesn't hank about it as much as we do.
TrainSen	00010	 My boyfriend lives in College Station and I miss him too.
TrainSen	00010	 It feels silly at times though to have this person you love and car about so much to have them so far form you let you still can keep close.
TrainSen	00010	 Technology is incredible.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm able to talk to Evan once a month.
TrainSen	00010	 He's in Africa for goodness sake that's an ocean away.
TrainSen	00010	 I talk to Michael every day usually more then once.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I'm getting hot, and I'm so thank ful the ac just flipped on.
TrainSen	00010	 I find it hard to believe people were ever comfortable without the air conditioning.
TrainSen	00010	 This summer at the camp I worked at we didn't have an ac in the cabin and I got used to it.
TrainSen	00010	 I fact I would get cold when I was in the ac.
TrainSen	00010	 But still the comfort of it is much better than without.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss camp I miss my campers.
TrainSen	00010	 It's the one place that I really feel at home way from home, I am so confident there.
TrainSen	00010	 not that I'm not here I just have been there for ten years and have grown up there.
TrainSen	00010	 All my best friends are there.
TrainSen	00010	 Of course I have other good friends but there just f=something about living with someone for three months that gives you a new look at them .
TrainSen	00010	 They learn your morning routine and you there's it  comfort thing because someone else knows you so well that they know how you wake very morning.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss those guys.
TrainSen	00010	 And it's not like I can't call them or even hang out with some but I don't.
TrainSen	00010	 Isn't that strange that I love these people so much yet I don't call and hang out either them.
TrainSen	00010	 Yes they call me and sometimes I don' t call them back because I'm nervous.
TrainSen	00010	 Why?  I don't understand my strange want to be with people but my stronger want to be alone and watch TV and just do nothing.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to start working out again, I t has been so long since I have I think I would have more of a desire to get up and go if I had more of a pep ""I just worked out"" kind of look on life.
TrainSen	00010	 I really love Lance Armstrong.
TrainSen	00010	 He had inspired so man people to get in shape and be healthy and support the fight against cancer that you just have to respect that.
TrainSen	00010	 I also respect him because he had the same cancer my daddy beat.
TrainSen	00010	 That was an awful time in my life.
TrainSen	00010	 Freshman year found out that my dad has cancer.
TrainSen	00010	 He's fine now but wow that scared me he wouldn't be here for so many things that he has seen it's incredible.
TrainSen	00010	 Medicine is absolutely incredible.
TrainSen	00010	 It makes me appreciate everything he does a lot more.
TrainSen	00010	 Funny how even when he was going through all that awful stuff I was pretty unaware.
TrainSen	00010	 My parents kinds kept us in the dark.
TrainSen	00010	 Not like I asked but we just didn't talk about it.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like I really don't know what happen to him during those months except that he got better and now he's doing great.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if he still thinks about it everyday or if he's let that terrible memory flee from his mind.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow he is one funny man, he can say anything and I'll laugh but I guess that's how it should be.
TrainSen	00010	 He should be my hero.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish every girl had a daddy like mine I think the world would be a make more relaxed kin of place.
TrainSen	00010	 He always makes every tense situation funny and more laid back.
TrainSen	00010	 My mom is the opposite and I wonder how hey have been together for 29 years when they are so opposite .
TrainSen	00010	 But I know she loves him and I think he loves her.
TrainSen	00010	 He does he just doesn't always shoe it in front of us but I'm sure he does to her.
TrainSen	00010	 He'll do really sweet stuff like on Valentines Day.
TrainSen	00010	 I think she just needs to relaxes a bit and realize that not every situation needs to blown out of proportion.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow that was really neat.
TrainSen	00010	go back back back to the disaster .
TrainSen	00010	 I can't get that song out of my head.
TrainSen	00010	 It was so weird on Courtney's board I couldn't understands what it meant till I read it out loud I wonder if spelling counts on this and if you can go back and correct mis spelled words  like they care.
TrainSen	00010	 I am so bored but so excite about the job I have essentially been doing the same thing for the past three years and I think that I can handle the work load but this is college and its suppose TO BE HARDER BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T BEEN I STILL NEED TO read some of the info in the art history book that girl pre adviser said it would be fun but so far it has been a snooze feast.
TrainSen	00010	 what else to write about I though that I would have bad dreams after watching train spotting with the dead baby in the cradle but I really having been dreaming much probably because I stay up half the night hanging out with the hall everybody seems pretty nice and all the guy are hot especially matt oh baby but I think that he likes Courtney everybody likes Courtney she has that Chicago accent and she pretty and nice I couldn't even get drunk guys to dance with me on Saturday the only guy I danced with was p and then when Steve said sorry to interrupt while we were dancing he said there was nothing to interrupt what a jerky think to say I mean I was standing right there it wasn't like he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying pritvi is funny but quite the little gossiper I really like my floor when they offer me a spot out side of supplemental housing I probably won't take I because I know so many people here and hopeful we can become good friends I haven't had any real friends for the past few years I been so involved in school but the weekends were so boring with out a school activity to do I seen a movie with a group of kids  twice one was after a school event and the other was after a church h think.
TrainSen	00010	 I saw movies that I didn't want to see and it was pretty much like any other movie I've seen by myself but I remember them better I only have ten more minutes left I like to count I'm always counting things like yesterday I counted lance Armstrong bracelets 9 on the way to the theater building and seven on the was back Courtney's doesn't count could I didn't see it on the walk I am so bored right now but I am going to be so busy with soccer, broccoli project, circle k, and hopefully crew or rowing which sound the same to me but apparently with rowing you only have one ore and with crew you have two I don't know what else to right where is Chris I so think that he forgot to knock on my door and just went off to lunch with Courtney.
TrainSen	10000	man I should have waited and gone to the restroom before I walked into the library's computer lab.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 Geez!!!!!!!!!.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 I really need to go but I can't because I have already began to write.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 Well now I know that I must hold it and wait for these 20 minutes to past.
TrainSen	10000	 Which could feel like forever.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow! looking around I see a lot of students working on something that must be important since they sit quietly stuck to the seat in front of their computer.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 Finally.
TrainSen	10000	 Today was the first day in which I ate with some friends from high school.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 Whom right now seem to be my only friends  here at UT if I am lucky to see them around in between classes.
TrainSen	10000	 I know I should try and make new friends because you know what they say, ""you meet your best and closest friends in college.
TrainSen	10000	 "" I have made attempts to talk to new people on campus, whether I'm sitting on the bus with someone I have never met or waiting in the hallway with another student for my next class to begin.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean I want to meet many new faces but then again I am worried that the people I approach don't want to be approached by a complete stranger.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know but I need to figure something out so I can enjoy every little bit of my college experience.
TrainSen	10000	 hey? wasn't there suppose to be a timer at the top of the screen? oh no I didn't bother checking what time I started to type!well it doesn't seem like 20 minutes just yet so ill keep typing about something.
TrainSen	10000	 Well, lately I have been having doubts about whether to change my major or not.
TrainSen	10000	 I am currently    a mechanical engineer major but have been thinking about switching to computer science.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel like I will have an easier time in computer science because I find it more interesting.
TrainSen	10000	 GEEZ!!!!! my arm is staring to hurt from all this typing and my fingers are all worn out.
TrainSen	10000	 I knew I should have taken that keyboarding class in middle school so I would learn to type properly and not with the same index fingers.
TrainSen	10000	 lately my mind has been full of worries and things that I need to do before deadlines.
TrainSen	10000	 this morning I went to the Austin Municipal Court to turn in my Defensive driving certificate and they didn't accept it because I need to pay off the balance of my citation first.
TrainSen	10000	 Now where am I going to get $137 right now? My books left me with an empty wallet and I have at least 2 weeks to come up with that money.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I'm just going to have to sell some of my valued belongings and maybe even donate plasma again.
TrainSen	10000	 Yup! I have donated blood before and have received money for it and I told myself it would be my first and last time to do it.
TrainSen	10000	 but it doesn't seem like its going to be that way! so I think its been 20 minutes now because I only had 45 minutes of log on time and I was just informed that I have 25 minutes left so yeah.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	ok wow I didn't see that timer going.
TrainSen	10000	 I put some music on so I could let my mind run free / walking from class to class is my exercise of the day / people were out running in the track at one in the morning/ I was just studying/man I have a lot to read/ the way I see it I either work hard for these four years or work hard for the rest of my life.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't even know what I want to be/ I guess your not suppose to/ I don't fit in right here/ the little people I've met here have 30 credit hours and are sophomore status/ I'm no where close/ I'm suppose to be doing laundry but I guess ill do that when I go home this weekend/ my hub is doing laundry right no with I forgot some clothes I left at home / I miss me some home cooking/ ummmm food.
TrainSen	10000	 / I can eat food all day.
TrainSen	10000	 even though I'm tiny/ chomper is what they call me.
TrainSen	10000	 / I want to play 'halo' maybe when I go home we can play.
TrainSen	10000	 I forgot I also have to get my license renewed.
TrainSen	10000	 / don't I need a v.
TrainSen	10000	 O.
TrainSen	10000	 E.
TrainSen	10000	 how would I get that in college/ everything is much more complicated here/ I don't know the town very well/ I like Austin's weirdness/ it reminds me of new York/ everyone doesn't care about how different you are and the way you look means nothing.
TrainSen	10000	 / a guy thought I was a cop and I was going to bring him down for selling fake Rolex/ I'm 95 pounds/ I feel like playing some softball/ maybe when I go home/ everything is when ""I go home"" I need to read after this/ got to make people proud/ I can't wait for next year when Edward comes here/ hopefully they accept his transfer/ it was funny trying to get into my dorm.
TrainSen	10000	 / oh well I guess sleeping in a car isn't so bad/ I like jewel/ she makes a lot of sense in her music/ and a lot of her music is on issues that are arguably big topics/ one of her songs made me think of ww2/ dogs were parachuted down with rations/ I found a dog around my street and named him 'black dog' /I'm not very creative.
TrainSen	10000	 / I tried five different places to put him in because I don't have money to take care of him/ I tried the places that don't put them down/ no one had space though/ the ones who are supposedly his owners are cruel they poured gasoline on him one day and I washed him up/ I used to watch that animal police shows/ what a dork/ I liked them though/ one of them had a case where they got to the suspects house and tried to take this dog in and it refuse to go.
TrainSen	10000	 it kept pulling in order to stay and it kept digging on the floor/ it turned out the dog was trying to save her 12 puppies that the owners tried to bury alive.
TrainSen	10000	 / that's sad.
TrainSen	10000	 / people are insane/ no matter how ill treated pets are especially dogs/ they will always love the owners/ its weird/ people wont get that/ being on a ferry in new York was crazy there were lots of people.
TrainSen	10000	 /pushing to get anywhere/ I saw jerry Seinfeld/ it was cool/ it literally is the city that never sleeps/ at four a clock in the morning they were still walking around/ I wonder when my roommate is getting here/ she likes Irish stuff/ I never asked if she was Irish.
TrainSen	10000	 / maybe I should ask.
TrainSen	10000	 / we need a bath mat and air freshener for those not so pleasant moments/ I should probably go down and rent us out a broom/ but I probably wont/ I'm hungry again and I just ate/ I'm going to become obese I can feel it.
TrainSen	10000	 / I don't want to get fat/ what a typical thing to say for a girl/ oh well I guess I'm typical/ can't wait till I go back home.
TrainSen	00001	Well its after classes on this Friday.
TrainSen	00001	 I am sll freaking' stressed out.
TrainSen	00001	 Stupid Fahkerrdine's quiz kicked my ass.
TrainSen	00001	 It's not that I don't know how to do it, it's just that I doubted myself.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know, ever since I have been here I think that I have gotten dumber, when in reality I am not.
TrainSen	00001	 I am actually pretty damn smart.
TrainSen	00001	 I am just letting what everyone says get to my head.
TrainSen	00001	 So it pretty much is my fault anyway.
TrainSen	00001	 Well from now on, I am going to walk around and take these stupid college quizzes and tests like I am smarter than the professor that made them.
TrainSen	00001	 I probably am smarter than most of these professors, unless they are freaking geniuses, which some of them are.
TrainSen	00001	 Damn I miss my girlfriend.
TrainSen	00001	 She is like so freaking hot.
TrainSen	00001	 Yeah I know she is sixteen but she doesn't look like it and I wouldn't be with her if she acted like a little girl.
TrainSen	00001	 She is more mature than most of the girls I have for classes and some of my close girl friends.
TrainSen	00001	 Damn I am sneezing well I am doing this in a friends room so yeah.
TrainSen	00001	 Well Jessica is hot and I miss her.
TrainSen	00001	 Its not really a distraction.
TrainSen	00001	 Today I was tired I have no idea why I have been sleeping more than I ever have.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't even read for classes.
TrainSen	00001	 College isn't even hard.
TrainSen	00001	 I could not read and make a C in all my classes but I want A's damnit.
TrainSen	00001	 Stupid medical school.
TrainSen	00001	 Wish I could fast forward my life about 8 years.
TrainSen	00001	 But I'll be a pinche viejo by then.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if because I am cussing the person that reads this will think I am an immature kid or ignorant, when in reality I probably have a more extensive vocabulary than them.
TrainSen	00001	 And its not like I am a big cusser.
TrainSen	00001	 Its just I have been so damn stressed lately.
TrainSen	00001	 I was doing my chemistry homework and I ran my hands through my hair and my hair was falling out.
TrainSen	00001	 Not like one or two try like 10 to 20 strands of hair.
TrainSen	00001	 Um.
TrainSen	00001	 went blank.
TrainSen	00001	 Nah its frustrating that thoughts come and go faster than I can type them out.
TrainSen	00001	 This keyboard's keys are all gay anyway.
TrainSen	00001	 Well, here I am in college.
TrainSen	00001	 Everyone once in a while it sets in.
TrainSen	00001	 They are a lot of hot girls here.
TrainSen	00001	 I really don't know if any of them are hotter than my girlfriend because I am in love.
TrainSen	00001	 and yeah love makes you blind in some ways.
TrainSen	00001	 I have been in love before.
TrainSen	00001	 Went out with one girl for almost all of high school cept the majority of my senior year.
TrainSen	00001	 Four damn years.
TrainSen	00001	 My feet stink and its driving me nuts.
TrainSen	00001	 Its like I can't wear sandals because they make my feet sweat so much.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if other people have that problem.
TrainSen	00001	 I am just going to by frebreze and shoot my damn sandals.
TrainSen	00001	 Its probably all the bacteria on my feet.
TrainSen	00001	 O well.
TrainSen	00001	 Tonight I think I am going to get drunk.
TrainSen	00001	 I have never drank before, well I have taken some sips like four.
TrainSen	00001	 Beer tastes like shit.
TrainSen	00001	 I am just going to drink ""chick"" drinks.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't care what guys say.
TrainSen	00001	 And if I do something stupid tonight o well, I need to wind down.
TrainSen	00001	 I have been more stressed than this before, but this seems to take a lot out of me and it doesn't feel like it, until you realize it.
TrainSen	00001	 O well.
TrainSen	00001	 Sucks to be in college.
TrainSen	00001	 You know my uncle is a millionaire and he is a college dropout.
TrainSen	00001	 In fact I would say most of the worlds millionaire's are college dropouts or didn't go or went because they were already rich.
TrainSen	00001	 I know I could do that but I don't know I guess I don't have enough confidence in myself to make it out there on my own.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't think I like to take chances that have that great of a chance to fail.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't like to leave things to chance.
TrainSen	00001	 But then life has screwed me over so many times before even when I was doing all the right things so what was the point.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean I didn't drink or do drugs I mean I tried marijuana once but c'mon that's not that bad.
TrainSen	00001	 I love God I would go to church and like it, I would have my quiet time, I would be a pretty good Christian example till like my jr.
TrainSen	00001	 year and what happened?  My parents got divorced, my dad made like all the money, there's five kids in my family, my dad went to jail for what he did.
TrainSen	00001	 Gosh damn I am still embarrassed of what he did.
TrainSen	00001	 So yeah all things this I was going to have like a nice car, my college paid for, super nice clothes I would have had it.
TrainSen	00001	 He mad 80,000 a year and my mom made 40,000, and that's not too bad when you live in the valley.
TrainSen	00001	 Its next to Mexico, and no we weren't drug dealers.
TrainSen	00001	 Hah.
TrainSen	00001	 that's funny if I hadn't put that in, you might have thought that.
TrainSen	00001	I thought of a million different ways I would start this, and now  I can't think of any.
TrainSen	00001	 Well,  one way, actually, was to say that this one time I had a conversation with my teacher about  whether people thought in complete sentences or not.
TrainSen	00001	 I told her they didn't, but now I think  they do.
TrainSen	00001	 That is, unless, they're answering questions.
TrainSen	00001	 In thinking that it's hot, I don't think,  ""hot"" I think ""It's hot.
TrainSen	00001	 ""  In any case, it's very cold in my room right now.
TrainSen	00001	 My hands and feet are  especially cold.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if that's simply because of the temperature of the room or that stress  stuff Dr.
TrainSen	00001	 Pennebaker was talking about.
TrainSen	00001	 Well the temperature used to be just fine, and now it's  cold all of the sudden.
TrainSen	00001	 We have to call those eminence guys.
TrainSen	00001	 They came last week and fixed  our toilet in like 10 seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 We didn't even see them, we just heard them.
TrainSen	00001	 I was joking with  my roommate that God came and fixed our toilet.
TrainSen	00001	 God rocks.
TrainSen	00001	 ha-ha I have a black t-shirt that  says that in white letters.
TrainSen	00001	 It's my old youth group t-shirt.
TrainSen	00001	 I designed it.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm quite proud of that.
TrainSen	00001	 It was cool and promoted God.
TrainSen	00001	 One guy once came up to me and asked me if it was being  sarcastic.
TrainSen	00001	 that wasn't cool.
TrainSen	00001	 He felt bad after asking though, he said he didn't mean to be rude.
TrainSen	00001	 I believe him.
TrainSen	00001	 He was a cool guy in several of my classes.
TrainSen	00001	 His name was Charlie.
TrainSen	00001	 There was  this other guy named Charlie, too.
TrainSen	00001	 He worked in the Emergency Room at the hospital where I  used to do my clinical rotations for school.
TrainSen	00001	 He was really cool too.
TrainSen	00001	 Actually me and my friend,  Erin, that got along with him really well kept in touch with him.
TrainSen	00001	 She just saw him recently at the  mall with his kids, and he told her some details about a friend of ours that died about three  weeks ago.
TrainSen	00001	 He was in the emergency room when it happened.
TrainSen	00001	 She was in a car accident and  died almost instantly.
TrainSen	00001	 It was pretty sad, but it didn't really affect me personally because she  wasn't that close to me.
TrainSen	00001	 However, my OA during orientation reminded me a lot of her, and  that's kind of eerie.
TrainSen	00001	 I say a guy that was an OA this summer at school last week.
TrainSen	00001	 That guy was  the one that stood out the most to me because he was the nicest looking.
TrainSen	00001	 (Not as in attractive,  as in sincerely nice.
TrainSen	00001	 )  Some people have that effect on me sometimes.
TrainSen	00001	 Like recently I went to  Hawaii and the guy that was the scuba diving instructor was named Jimmy.
TrainSen	00001	 Jimmy was really  cool, and he had that effect on me.
TrainSen	00001	 He just seemed like a sincerely nice guy.
TrainSen	00001	 I'll probably  remember him for a while.
TrainSen	00001	 I've had several people have that effect on me.
TrainSen	00001	 It's interesting to  meet so many people around the world that are absolutely amazing, and they may not even  know it.
TrainSen	00001	 They're absolutely amazing to me, and I don't even know why.
TrainSen	00001	 It's awesome.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I  could keep in touch with someone halfway across the world for a long time.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to find  someone first.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe if I get to study abroad in Italy I'll find someone to keep in touch with.
TrainSen	00001	 Things always seem to get in the way of stuff like that, every day life I guess.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know what  it is.
TrainSen	00001	 I do have this one friend, Marcus, I've kept in touch with him for about two years now.
TrainSen	00001	 I  met him at a medical program one summer, and we've kept in touch since.
TrainSen	00001	 That summer I did  lots of stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 I went to Canada for World Youth Day, and I got to see the pope.
TrainSen	00001	 Some people got  really emotional about that.
TrainSen	00001	 They were crying and stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 I kind of felt bad because I wasn't  crying, but I know there really is no reason I should feel guilty.
TrainSen	00001	 God did not say, ""Thou shall be  overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing the pope and come to tears.
TrainSen	00001	 ""  hah it would be kind of  funny if it said that in the bible.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyway, that summer I also went to LDZ.
TrainSen	00001	 That was one of the  greatest experiences ever.
TrainSen	00001	 I've stumbled upon a few people here at UT that said, ""You were  governor at LDZ, right?"" It's pretty cool how lives cross.
TrainSen	00001	 There are so many people at UT, who  wouldn't you find?  ha-ha The Monday before classes started I had an audition to try out for the  longhorn singers and we were in this tiny room in the music building, and who should walk in  the door but M.
TrainSen	00001	 C.
TrainSen	00001	 Hammer himself!! Hahira It was hilarious!! He was apparently showing his  daughter around because she wanted to get in choir at UT.
TrainSen	00001	 That's definitely a story worth  telling.
TrainSen	00001	 I didn't recognize him.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm to young I guess.
TrainSen	00001	 I always figured M.
TrainSen	00001	 C.
TrainSen	00001	 Hammer was white  only because I knew Vanilla Ice was.
TrainSen	00001	 ha-ha  Anyway, this whole time I've been writing I've also  been thinking about Alex.
TrainSen	00001	 Alex (in one sentence) is the boy I've been in love with almost my  entire life.
TrainSen	00001	 The reason why I've been thinking about him now is because a lot of the times I  write anything in journals or about what I'm thinking it's usually about him.
TrainSen	00001	 I know this is  simply ""stream of consciousness"" but I guess I can't just write what I'm thinking without  thinking of him.
TrainSen	00001	 Recently he wrote me an email after I hadn't emailed him in a while.
TrainSen	00001	 I was  waiting for him to write me.
TrainSen	00001	 It was short and mostly insignificant, but he wrote.
TrainSen	00001	 I just want to  be friends, I think.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know what I want.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to have lots of fun in college.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to  experience life, then I can figure out what I want with him.
TrainSen	00001	 It's probably not even my choice to  decided what I want with him.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyway, another thing I also always thought about was whether  deaf people saw signs in there heads instead of heard words when they were thinking.
TrainSen	10000	I got home from Burnet today from hunting and it wasn't that great.
TrainSen	10000	 The dove weren't flying when I was there maybe its because I'm bad luck.
TrainSen	10000	 Sometimes I think stupid things like that, like maybe for instance people were catching fish before I got there then when I got there I didn't catch anything and neither did anybody else.
TrainSen	10000	 Super smells really good right now I think mom is cooking mashed potatoes and ribs.
TrainSen	10000	 Sounds really good because I'm so hungry I haven't eaten all day.
TrainSen	10000	 Speaking of not eating all day I just realized how fun my weekend was.
TrainSen	10000	 That's why I haven't really eaten that much.
TrainSen	10000	 Food sounds so good.
TrainSen	10000	 Friday night I went out to a few parties and tried to get into frat parties but they're all gay and wont let any dudes in.
TrainSen	10000	 Even though it was me with a bunch of girls they still wouldn't let me in.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm pissed.
TrainSen	10000	 From now on when I have a party I'm not letting any frat people in just hot sorority girls.
TrainSen	10000	 Some of my friends are in sororities they seem cool.
TrainSen	10000	 Anyway, then I went to the UT game on Saturday and we stomped all over North Texas.
TrainSen	10000	 I kind of felt bad but not really.
TrainSen	10000	 Its weird to be at a UT game and say ""this is my school.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  I'm so used to being in high school and going to high school games I'm not used to seeing 80000 people at a game for my school.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish school didn't involve class.
TrainSen	10000	 I love the college atmosphere but not the class part.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe my psychology professor will give me an A.
TrainSen	10000	 That would be great of him.
TrainSen	10000	 He's a cool guy though I like his class.
TrainSen	10000	 All my other professors are boring but he knows how to have fun while he lectures.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm glad I got out of my calculus class and in a different one because professor radin is not cool at all.
TrainSen	10000	 he needs to learn how to be not so uptight.
TrainSen	10000	 My new calculus professor is cool though he's more laid back and knows how to teach things and give examples.
TrainSen	10000	 Gosh I'm hungry I wish dinner were ready already.
TrainSen	10000	 Taco Cabana is really good late at night I just realized that.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm glad it's open 24 hrs because where would I go eat at 3 a.
TrainSen	10000	 M?  Speaking of Taco Cabana San Antonio was fun I just wish we went to Cowboys and danced a little.
TrainSen	10000	 San Antonio was cool but not as cool as burnet I want to hurry up and go hunting again.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe this weekend I'll go back and shoot some more birds.
TrainSen	10000	 Girls make me so mad.
TrainSen	10000	 Why does a certain somebody have to be stupid all the time?  She bitches too much at me for little things.
TrainSen	10000	 I should just not talk to her anymore.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know why I can't just not talk to her.
TrainSen	10000	 All girls are the same to me, they all bitch about stupid things and get mad at you for saying hi to other girls that are your friends but they go off and say hi to their guy friends and expect us not to get mad at them.
TrainSen	10000	 It's dumb.
TrainSen	10000	 Jenna is dumb too.
TrainSen	10000	 She should have ditched her boyfriend to hang out with her quote best friend Kelly on her birthday.
TrainSen	10000	 She is stupid for choosing someone she just barely met over her best friend.
TrainSen	10000	 Kelly doesn't deserve to cry I should yell at Jenna for that.
TrainSen	10000	 Jessica is a cool girl she cares about me and doesn't want anything to happen to me I should hang out with her more.
TrainSen	10000	 Stony Point football will always suck.
TrainSen	10000	 They lose too much.
TrainSen	10000	 New coaches are cool though I wish he was there when I was there.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to do chemistry homework.
TrainSen	10000	 He needs to stop mumbling and getting off topic to.
TrainSen	10000	 My TA pisses me off so much I think I'm smarter than her.
TrainSen	10000	 All the answers I had were right and the ones she gave me were wrong I can't believe that.
TrainSen	10000	 66 on the first hw is crap.
TrainSen	10000	 there goes my confidence.
TrainSen	10000	 She's a good looking girl though I'll give her that much but she can't help for crap.
TrainSen	10000	 hopefully by this weekend I'll have my work done so I can hunt.
TrainSen	10000	 I really can't stop thinking about hunting.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to shoot me a deer I've never shot one before.
TrainSen	10000	 Season opens soon I think so dove will have to do for now.
TrainSen	00001	I am sitting here thinking about what I am going to eat .
TrainSen	00001	 I am very hungry.
TrainSen	00001	 for lunch i had a sala, some pasta and some soup, oh that guy was really hot .
TrainSen	00001	 when I work out today those guys are going to be really hot too.
TrainSen	00001	 oh god something stinks.
TrainSen	00001	 i wonder what it is .
TrainSen	00001	 I hope its not the person sitting next tome.
TrainSen	00001	 what is that girl wearing she looks very tacky.
TrainSen	00001	 when I go to my dorm later I am going to fall out.
TrainSen	00001	 First I have to call my parents or they will get mad .
TrainSen	00001	 this is a library why are people walking around and talking so much.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder why my roommate does the stuff she does, and why is this person talking so what is wrong with his hear okay it is really starting to stink.
TrainSen	00001	 oh crap I'm supposed to meet my roommate for lunch but oh well it doesn't matter, this is much more important.
TrainSen	00001	 Last night the MTV music wards were so crazy, there were a lot of crazy things happening everywhere, I thought I was going to flip.
TrainSen	00001	 I absolutely loved what Beyonce and Alicia Keys were wearing.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder when will Destiny's child get back together hopefully soon.
TrainSen	00001	 Man I hope I did good on my Spanish quiz it was fairly easy I think.
TrainSen	00001	 What classes do I have tomorrow hopefully easy ones because I can't stand some of my classes.
TrainSen	00001	 i wonder what my roommate is doing right now.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if my exboyfriend has a girlfriend right now.
TrainSen	00001	 man when will this be over 20 minutes is a long time to just write about anything.
TrainSen	00001	 ooh another hot boy oh and there is his girlfriend.
TrainSen	00001	 That's okay I look better than her anyways.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what my friends are doing in El Paso maybe I'll give them  a call when I have time.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm so excited the first football game is this week what am i going to wear who am I going to go with Hopefully we will beat north Texas.
TrainSen	00001	 oh my god games mean after parties and after parties mean really hot football players too bad I'm only 17 I can probably still get into some clubs.
TrainSen	00001	 the ones that allow babies.
TrainSen	00001	 Man it seems like I have been on here for years when is this crap going to end.
TrainSen	00001	 wow my stomach just growled really loud, hopefully no one heard me but if they did ohg well I know they are probably having the same problem.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what my brother is doing I wonder if he quit the football team yet I told him he should just do track but he didn't believe me so that is his fault, but he'll learn they always do.
TrainSen	00010	that fish tank sure is loud as crap I didn't know havoline was a 100 years old corona sucks I am hungry and it is hot in the apartment that bastard didn't come fix my garbage disposal I wasn't to play golf I need contact solution this guy is a douche crap its hot  I am hungry as shit I want dry I don't want to do homework tonight and I need a can of dip bad so much for quitting time Warner sucks the stros better win and hopefully barry will die along with the giants I want to play poor tonight I better call trip and fox and peter this piece of shit is turning into a list of things to do and now I am talking to the list I want to go to a game and get drunk tonight that prescreening took for fucking ever I wonder how old frank Thomas is I am only on the 4th minute I wish I still played baseball maybe if I didn't suck at catching I could be should've tried short I need to get that little league thing done and the volunteer shit I fucked my neck up and damnit I am hungry I should be turned on a light my eyes hurt and this laptop is hot laundry son of a bitch I have no quarters well that and homework will be my kick ass thruway night after this is over in 14 minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 I haven't done anything in the last 3 Thursdays that is pathetic pasta or rice or potatoes.
TrainSen	00001	This is weird and different.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not exactly sure what I should be writing.
TrainSen	00001	 I really love it when guys can play the guitar.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know what it is but guys who play the guitar are my biggest weakness.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope, oh I forgot what I was going to say.
TrainSen	00001	 that happens a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 Twenty minutes seems like a long time.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyway, I'm listening to Hotel California by The Eagles and then I think I'm going to listen to my Sublime Cd.
TrainSen	00001	 The Beatles were like musical geniuses.
TrainSen	00001	 I bet them and Frank Sinatra are the celebrities that got the most sex from random women.
TrainSen	00001	 I would have had sex with Frank Sinatra back in the day.
TrainSen	00001	 I made a list of celebrities I would have no problems having sex with- it isn't very long but I'll share it because I really don't care.
TrainSen	00001	 It's not like I'll ever have sex with these people anyway let's see it was Lindsay Lohan, Michael Vartan, John Mayer, and Jake Gyllenhaal.
TrainSen	00001	 I bet John Mayer is an excellent lover.
TrainSen	00001	 No one who plays the guitar (and sings wonderful love songs) with that much emotion and feeling is a bad lover.
TrainSen	00001	 Huh, I don't think that made sense, it made sense in my head.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm so glad Stephie is my roommate.
TrainSen	00001	 We have our differences but for the most part we get a long so well.
TrainSen	00001	 Sex and the City is such an awesome show.
TrainSen	00001	 I think each woman has a little bit of all four of the girls in them.
TrainSen	00001	 Is it bad that sometimes I want to push my morals aside and do things I know are ""wrong"".
TrainSen	00001	 Since I've gotten here my friends that go to other schools are bashing my new life style.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate that they judge me.
TrainSen	00001	 Why can't I just live my life the way I want to? Being active in the church youth group in high school was one of the best things I've ever done but now that I'm doing things that The Church wouldn't approve of I'm noticing that I'm pushing everything I used to stand for aside so that I can ""experiment"" with different things.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't regret anything I do, but sometimes I don't think I make the best decisions.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm happy though and I guess that's all that matters.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm sure God is an understanding God.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not sure what's worse living my life as a straight edge or being taken up by the flashiness of college life.
TrainSen	00001	 sounds like a lose lose situation to me.
TrainSen	00001	 I really need to lose some weight man.
TrainSen	00001	 I was sitting in the hookah bar tonight and this girl said she lost 73 pounds in a year and that she used to weigh 210.
TrainSen	00001	 So now she weighs.
TrainSen	00001	 137.
TrainSen	00001	 wow.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to lose that much weight.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder how she did it.
TrainSen	00001	 I should have asked her.
TrainSen	00001	 some days I'll feel really self confident and pretty and I'm like well I guess I love myself the way I am so someone will love me for me as well.
TrainSen	00001	 Then other days I'm like ""fuck, who's going to love a fat slob"".
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I meet the one in college.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope he's amazing in every way.
TrainSen	00001	 Is it too much to ask to meet my soul mate? That would be sweet.
TrainSen	00001	 First things first though.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to shed the pounds ASAP.
TrainSen	00001	 yes.
TrainSen	00001	 After this I have to study Italian.
TrainSen	00001	 That's going to suck.
TrainSen	00001	 I probably should have done that instead of sleeping the day away.
TrainSen	00001	 oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 This week was a lot more productive then last.
TrainSen	00001	 So this weekend I plan to really catch up and get my shit together.
TrainSen	00001	 I really need to pull my GPA up.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to do good.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm going to do good.
TrainSen	00001	 I just wish I weren't so damn lazy.
TrainSen	00001	 Bah.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I were going to college station tomorrow.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to see my old friends but I don't know why if they're just going to look at me like I'm the devil.
TrainSen	00001	 My leg is still twitching.
TrainSen	00001	 That probably isn't a good thing.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm sad pookie's leaving this weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I could find someone who enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss Chris so much.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish every time I was with him could be like that night after the John Mayer concert.
TrainSen	00001	 he's so much fun to be around.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I come off as bitchy and annoying but I'm not sure.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish someone would tell me.
TrainSen	00001	 I have the Beatles song ""Black bird"" stuck in my head.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to take guitar lessons I just wish they weren't so damn expensive.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm so glad I only have one class tomorrow! Yay! I kind of don't want to go to the welcome retreat thing but maybe it will be for the better.
TrainSen	00001	 Otherwise looks like I will be going to college station.
TrainSen	00001	 We'll see how that works out.
TrainSen	01000	I can't believe that I missed my first class this morning.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know what happened.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe my roommate turned off my alarm early and didn't tell me.
TrainSen	01000	 But I don't think so, because he's a good guy and he wouldn't do that.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope there wasn't a quiz in kinesiology today.
TrainSen	01000	 That would just be my luck.
TrainSen	01000	 The one time I miss it, there was a quiz.
TrainSen	01000	 Man this sucks not having books, I'm getting so far behind in all my classes reading.
TrainSen	01000	 It's going to be hard to catch up.
TrainSen	01000	 There are some many people in all my classes it's ridiculous.
TrainSen	01000	 You know what else is ridiculous, not having books.
TrainSen	01000	 Why can't I get into shape faster?  I know it takes time, but I've been running for 3 weeks and I don't see  much of an improvement.
TrainSen	01000	 If I am going to walk on the cross country team here I need to be faster than I was in high school.
TrainSen	01000	 My old high school team mates are not doing so hot right now.
TrainSen	01000	 The top runners are running about one minute and a half behind what we were running last year.
TrainSen	01000	 I was running 16:26 for a 5K, but these guys are running like 17:40 for a 5K.
TrainSen	01000	 They are going to have a lot of time to make up if they are going to be competitive in one of the toughest districts in the state, second to only the woodlands district.
TrainSen	01000	 God, I hate the woodlands, and cedar park, and Georgetown.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I hadn't injured myself during track season, cause I had to take 3 months off the heal.
TrainSen	01000	 And three months with no running killed me.
TrainSen	01000	 I gained like 20 pounds during the summer session here at UT.
TrainSen	01000	 But summer school was so much fun.
TrainSen	01000	 I met lots of cool guys like Kevin, rahim, and Justin.
TrainSen	01000	 And a lot of girls.
TrainSen	01000	 Actually too many girls to count, but out of all those girls, I don't think any of them found me attractive at all.
TrainSen	01000	 And when ever some girl approaches me at a party, some one will swoop in take her.
TrainSen	01000	 Some one like Kevin or rahim.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm still mad for what Kevin did.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe that he ""made out"" with my best friend and the girl that I love so much.
TrainSen	01000	 That just sucked.
TrainSen	01000	 I felt like some one had ripped out my heart and then run it over with several big rigs, then dropped it off a high building, then feed it to piranhas in the Amazon rain forest.
TrainSen	01000	 But I know Kevin didn't do that one purpose, or did he?  But I had a long talk with both Heather and Kevin, and we're cool.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh and Heather is coming to visit this weekend!  I am so excited! I haven't seen her since before school started like 4 weeks ago.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm disappointed because she was supposed to come to UT but she didn't get into articture school so she had to go to atm, but she is going to transfer her in a year.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to plan a fun weekend with stuff for us to do, so she and I can have a good time again.
TrainSen	01000	 But what do I do?  I have to work part of sat and sun, but we still can have fun Friday and then after I get off work.
TrainSen	01000	 I just want her to be happy, if its not with me then so be it.
TrainSen	01000	 But I will marry her, I will marry her, because I love her so much and she is my best friend.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope she feels the same way.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know what to do, cause I don't want to mess up our perfect friendship, oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 We will have to see what unfolds.
TrainSen	00001	Today was a pretty calm day.
TrainSen	00001	 Nothing outrageous happened.
TrainSen	00001	 Right now I feel hungry, probably because the last time I ate was at 6:50 or so and I didn't have much.
TrainSen	00001	 I tired this new stir fry stuff and some mashed potatoes.
TrainSen	00001	 It was ok but I guess it was only filling for the time being.
TrainSen	00001	 I almost forgot I had this assignment due tomorrow.
TrainSen	00001	 I sprang out of bed as soon as I remembered.
TrainSen	00001	 earlier my suite mates and I watched a movie at the union called Mean Girls.
TrainSen	00001	 It was good and they showed it for free too so there were a lot of people there.
TrainSen	00001	 They show a lot of movies at the union.
TrainSen	00001	 The next dorm family event planned for us is to go and watch the movie Troy.
TrainSen	00001	 My roommate's friend is going to make her and I watch the movie schindler's list sometime soon.
TrainSen	00001	 He is a big movie fan and is going into the college of communication and he wants to be a director later on.
TrainSen	00001	 He has already made a movie.
TrainSen	00001	 He made it in high school and he went around and just videotaped the different events and people at school.
TrainSen	00001	 My roommate said it was good.
TrainSen	00001	 She just told me that her chemistry professor wrote the book they use in class.
TrainSen	00001	 Its not just him but he has contributed to writing the book.
TrainSen	00001	 He has his name on the cover of the book and everything.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm going home to Houston next weekend to see my family and to attend this bayou bhangra competition that all my friends are going to.
TrainSen	00001	 Its going to be really fun.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait to see my baby sister she's just too cute for me.
TrainSen	00001	 I love her and she's a miracle baby too especially because she serviced through my mom's accident and all the medication my mom had to take during her pregnancy.
TrainSen	00001	 But I guess that's God's love and blessing and I am very thankful for everything he as done for me and my family but I don't know what to think of him after my aunt and uncle's freak accident and death.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't understand why he sends us these extraordinary people and then just takes them away from us before its time for them to go.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know I suppose its just one of those things that happen and can't be explained.
TrainSen	00001	 And I believe that things happen for a reason but I don't know how God can justify their death and all these things that have been happening to our entire family.
TrainSen	00001	 Things haven't seem to be right ever since my grandmother passed away.
TrainSen	00001	 Well that's all I can think of to write about and its time now too, how convenient.
TrainSen	10000	twenty seconds and I still haven't thought of anything.
TrainSen	10000	 Jennifer is crazy for taking all those chemistry classes! I couldn't even work on my math problems, and concentrate.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know how she makes it all those hours with science and math.
TrainSen	10000	 We're going to watch that movie tonight, in a little while, so I need to finish my homework pretty soon, and get a head start on the week, so I don't have too much to worry about.
TrainSen	10000	 I need stop freaking out the ghost in our community bathroom! Those shower curtains don't open themselves! I wonder is molly is going to be happy for me and jen about being the new wing representatives? wow that's a big word.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if that's how you spell it.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to clean up my room before my roommate throws my stuff out in the hall.
TrainSen	10000	 Stupid jose can't really mean what he said.
TrainSen	10000	 He said he's not IN love with me, and just loves me.
TrainSen	10000	 But I know we'll get back together.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm sure of that.
TrainSen	10000	 Now.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 Whhooooahhhh I clicked that button too many times.
TrainSen	10000	 I really hope they don't run out of the poster I want.
TrainSen	10000	 I signed up to work for 5 hours at the poster sales to get $50 worth of credit for that poster starry night.
TrainSen	10000	 wow that hairstyle's weird.
TrainSen	10000	 That guy must work hard to get it like that.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe I should stop looking out the door.
TrainSen	10000	 it's too quiet in here, since jen doesn't listen to her music out loud.
TrainSen	10000	 I love that people miss me back home, and that makes me feel like I was someone back there.
TrainSen	10000	 the more I look around this room, the more I like the color purple.
TrainSen	10000	 I remember the superman theme from stucco, and the way Michael looked in his cape.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I had my photo album with me right now to show jen.
TrainSen	10000	 mmmmmmmmmmuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaa the eyes of Texas are upon you.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 Today's lunch was super cool, because me and jen went back to the buffet, where she saw her friend who also happens to be Hispanic too! I was so glad when I saw Hispanics here.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to add more people to my yahoo, because I only have four people.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know why more people here don't have messenger, like people back home.
TrainSen	10000	 this is so cool, because it keeps you thinking, and you see it right in front of you.
TrainSen	10000	 This is so much fun, I should do this more often and then find the pattern of what I seem to think about more often.
TrainSen	10000	 darn! my time is already running out.
TrainSen	10000	 this was fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm down to like 15 seconds.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I did this assignment right.
TrainSen	10000	I am sitting here in my dorm room trying to organize my time for the rest of the day and night.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a lot of reading to catch up on.
TrainSen	10000	 I have trouble sitting down reading for a long period of time.
TrainSen	10000	 I would rather sit in a lecture and listen to a professor.
TrainSen	10000	 That is, if he/she is interesting.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to read and understand my psychology book, but for some reason I haven't been able to concentrate on it.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel like I am behind in this class for some reason.
TrainSen	10000	 My mom graduated with a degree in psychology.
TrainSen	10000	 She loved it.
TrainSen	10000	 My biology class is my favorite.
TrainSen	10000	 My professor is interesting and the book is interesting to me too.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I knew what I wanted to be.
TrainSen	10000	 I have so many different ideas and I can't decide right now.
TrainSen	10000	 I talked to my mom today and she suggested marine biology because she knew I used to be interested in that.
TrainSen	10000	 She also suggested being a doctor.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know if I can go to school for 8 more years though.
TrainSen	10000	 Four more years seems like a lot to me.
TrainSen	10000	 But I know I will do it.
TrainSen	10000	 I just feel weird right now I guess because I am just starting.
TrainSen	10000	 I am 3 and a half hours away from home.
TrainSen	10000	 I like it here but I miss it there.
TrainSen	10000	 I always have a lot on my mind and I think that is why it has been hard to concentrate on reading lately.
TrainSen	10000	 Eight months ago, 2 days before Christmas, my boyfriend of 3 years, Phillip, was killed in a car accident.
TrainSen	10000	 I almost didn't come to UT because he was supposed to follow me here and live in Austin too so we could be together.
TrainSen	10000	 I thought about that a lot the first week I was here.
TrainSen	10000	 It is just really hard.
TrainSen	10000	 This is one of the reasons I am being in my reading for philosophy and psychology.
TrainSen	10000	 I've been doing homework all week making up for last week.
TrainSen	10000	 When it comes to school work I love being ahead.
TrainSen	10000	 Which is why I am doing this writing assignment a week in advance.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm hoping that I will feel better when I finish this and I will be able to read 2 chapters and comprehend it.
TrainSen	10000	 When I stay ahead in school I always feel so much better.
TrainSen	10000	 I like to read the sections before lectures rather than after.
TrainSen	10000	 I am the type of person that takes on big load and I tend to get stressed out easy that way.
TrainSen	10000	 I decided that when I came here I was strictly going to concentrate on school.
TrainSen	10000	 In high school I had a full schedule of ap classes, a job, and participated in athletics.
TrainSen	10000	 I loved all of it but I decided I need a break from every thing else which is why I'm not working this semester.
TrainSen	10000	 I worked 6 days a week this past summer to save up for spending money this year so that I would not have to worry about working.
TrainSen	10000	 My parents are paying for my school and all my bills, even my gas so I don't ever want to ask them for spending money.
TrainSen	10000	 I received some scholarship money from Dobie, UT from my home town.
TrainSen	10000	 We have community scholarship that they give out every year.
TrainSen	10000	 There was a scholarship made in Phillips name this year.
TrainSen	10000	 I got that one.
TrainSen	10000	 That made me feel good I guess.
TrainSen	10000	 I like being here but it is just really weird.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I adjust to Austin soon.
TrainSen	10000	 I already like it a lot better than when I first move here 2 weeks ago.
TrainSen	00010	I feel that I have so much to do in the next few days.
TrainSen	00010	 College is so overrated.
TrainSen	00010	 The few actual moments that you do have to go out and party and have a good time, or do whatever it is that you like doing, equal all the other times you are reading, reading, studying, or doing other school stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 I had a French vanilla cappuccino at like 9:30 tonight and it gave me so much energy that I can't sit and focus on one thing.
TrainSen	00010	 It seems that I have been procrastinating all night.
TrainSen	00010	 Oooh all that I need is you (so the song I am listening to right now) but anyways.
TrainSen	00010	 now I don't remember what I was thinking about a moment ago.
TrainSen	00010	 It must be that caffeine I'm not really used to but have consumed so much of it in the last 48 hours.
TrainSen	00010	 O no.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not really sure what I just did.
TrainSen	00010	 I hit tab because that's what you do to indent but it hit the finish button instead.
TrainSen	00010	 So instead of having a stream of conscious thought for 20 minutes I think it was more like 2 so now I'm thinking about how I need to get in contact with the TA or the professor and explain how I will probably have two submissions but I'm not really sure because I don't know how computers work.
TrainSen	00010	 They are so complex.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't really understand them.
TrainSen	00010	 Like earlier I couldn't log into the prescreening experimental stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 I have put off the computer oriented stuff to later because in a way it scares me because I don't really trust them.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm very skeptical of them.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like if I start something the computer has a mind of its own and is going to do whatever with it.
TrainSen	00010	 Like just now, I'm panicking because the stupid machine is making an awful whirling twirling noise.
TrainSen	00010	 The song I'm listening to is sung by a different group, but the same song I did a trio to two years ago and it is bringing back memories of practicing and performing.
TrainSen	00010	 During a heavy practice time I had mono I remember.
TrainSen	00010	 Kind of a cool time because I got to miss almost two weeks of school but the makeup work wasn't fun but I did get to know my teachers well that year.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder how the other two girls that I did the trio with are doing.
TrainSen	00010	 They are both a year older than me so they've been doing this whole college thing longer.
TrainSen	00010	 Speaking of long I just looked at the time and I've only been doing this for like five minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 Looking at the clock and counting down the time reminds me of times during drill team practice after school when they seemed to drag on forever I made it a goal to not look at the clock so hopefully the time would pass by faster but of course it didn't.
TrainSen	00010	 I actually saw a girl from my drill team this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 She is a choreographer for a dance team I was interested in trying out for, but I decided not too because it brought back to many memories.
TrainSen	00010	 I am thinking about trying out for Steel Dance this weekend but I don't know yet.
TrainSen	00010	 O yaw that reminds me that I need to email one of the girls on the team and ask her what the dress code for the clinic is because I really don't want to wear pink tights and a black leotard.
TrainSen	00010	 It makes me feel fat.
TrainSen	00010	 Which reminds me I never ate dinner tonight and its like 110.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess all the Julius chips and salsa I ate will have to do.
TrainSen	00010	 Thank goodness for Julio.
TrainSen	00010	 He makes some awesome chips.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder who Julio is.
TrainSen	00010	 Or even if Julio is still alive.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate brought his chips back from Del Rio.
TrainSen	00010	 My Hippo something we learned about in class today must be working hard because it is bringing back many memories.
TrainSen	00010	 I think ill remember the name of it well or not the name more the function of it because my boyfriend has a horrible memory and we always joke about being big like hippos and stuff so I definitely will remember that one.
TrainSen	00010	 O look more remember things.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess the hippo thing is working right now.
TrainSen	00010	 The song I'm listening to reminds me of two girls on my drill team.
TrainSen	00010	 Rachel and Shea.
TrainSen	00010	 They were awesome dancers.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder where they are now.
TrainSen	00010	 There is a girl in my architecture design class that reminds me of shea the way she looks and talks.
TrainSen	00010	 Actually Shea has a pair of my comfy pants that I loved that my friend Brittney had on tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 Shea is in Utah so I don't think I will ever see them again.
TrainSen	00010	 Speaking of comfy clothes I wonder why all I wear to class now are soffe shorts and a t-shirt.
TrainSen	00010	 It must be that whole college thing.
TrainSen	00010	 O no.
TrainSen	00010	 Here goes again.
TrainSen	00010	 That whirling noise and now my instant messenger signed on when I didn't even click on the program.
TrainSen	00010	 This computer is so random.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe I just need to update the AIM program.
TrainSen	00010	 but then again I don't know that much about computers so I'm not really sure how I'd go about doing that.
TrainSen	00010	 With my luck I'd probably download some computer virus with it too.
TrainSen	00010	 And viruses.
TrainSen	00010	 That thing about getting sick when you are most stressed.
TrainSen	00010	 I will probably be getting sick soon because I am feeling very stressed right now although a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder today when we turned in a major project.
TrainSen	00010	 Which didn't go exactly how I hoped but its over so I don't want to think about it.
TrainSen	00010	 If I say I am going to get sick will my body start thinking that and make itself sick? That is something else we learned about.
TrainSen	00010	 If you start thinking one thing you can convince yourself of it.
TrainSen	00010	 O man I don't remember the name of it.
TrainSen	00010	 I am really going to have to study for this test.
TrainSen	00010	 I should probably start this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 Well there is one more thing to add to my to do list.
TrainSen	00010	 I started one earlier and it just keeps getting longer.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to add that I need to talk to a TA for this class and then email that girl from steel dance before I forget.
TrainSen	00010	 My 20 minutes is up now its a good thing I ended with that to do list so maybe since it is the most recent thing I will remember.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I really like this song.
TrainSen	00010	 Its from 13 going on 30 that movie.
TrainSen	00010	 I have started watching more movies since I got to college I think that is what I will ask for for my birthday-movies.
TrainSen	00010	 O yaw my time is up.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to get ready for bed so maybe I will get a decent amount of sleep tonight.
TrainSen	00001	I just got back from the University Democrats meeting.
TrainSen	00001	 It was really fun and informative.
TrainSen	00001	 Lloyd Doggett was the guest speaker.
TrainSen	00001	 He was very eloquent and well-versed, and he did an excellent job stating what he stood for and how the current gerrymandering is unfair, but we're not going to let it stop the party from victory.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope to get really involved with it.
TrainSen	00001	 It seems like a great way to get to know people and learn a lot about the political system at the same time.
TrainSen	00001	 Other than University Democrat, I'm going to try to join UBC, Undergraduate Business Council.
TrainSen	00001	 You have to fill out an application to become an At-Large member.
TrainSen	00001	 The questions appeal to the creative side in applicant, so I hope that my creativity steps up to the plate.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that UBC would also be a great way to meet people, especially since it's for students in the Business school.
TrainSen	00001	 I also want to join Student Government.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that some of the causes that they fight for are so worthwhile, like trying to extend the hours of the library.
TrainSen	00001	 Student Council in High School didn't really accomplish that much, but I think that Student Government actually gets things done here.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm listening to the Shins right now, they're a really good band.
TrainSen	00001	 I love the melodies and guitar.
TrainSen	00001	 Other bands that I like include Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, The Sounds, Belle and Sebastian, The Strokes, and so much more.
TrainSen	00001	 Basically anyone on Saddle Creek records tends to be really good because they all sound so different.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't really been able to find out about new music lately though because I've been sort of busy.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm taking 14 hours, and my classes are Statistics, Latin 506, Psych, and Microeconomics.
TrainSen	00001	 They're all pretty good so far, all my professors are pretty nice.
TrainSen	00001	 I've had a lot of reading to do, and I've been pretty much doing my best to do it all.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm waiting for a couple of books to come in.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm waiting for my Microeconomics book and a Latin book to come in.
TrainSen	00001	 I really wanted to take Intro to Political Philosophy instead of Latin, but oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm thinking about doing International Business, and Latin is the basis of all the Romance languages, so I hope it will help me with other languages.
TrainSen	00001	 International Business seems to be like an interesting major, but I still don't know what I want to do.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm probably doing Pre-Med as well, and I also want to take some RTF classes.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't think that you can take RTF classes without majoring in it though, so I'm going to have to apply to that college, I guess.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I figure out what I want to do because International Business, Pre-med, and RTF are pretty hard to do all together, and I don't want to take longer than four years to finish all that.
TrainSen	00001	 I honestly don't know what I want to do, I want to do something worthwhile, something different, something exciting, something that's definitely not your average 8 to 5 job, something that truly helps people.
TrainSen	00001	 I only hope that someday I will realize what I want to do.
TrainSen	00001	 Although in life, everyone wants something more, no matter what people have, they usually want something more.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope that whatever happens, I am content with what I have.
TrainSen	00001	 Man, this Shins song, ""Saint Simon"" is so good.
TrainSen	00001	 They're coming to Austin soon, I can't wait to see them.
TrainSen	00001	 Bright Eyes is also coming soon, in October.
TrainSen	00001	 That is going to be such a good show, it's been like two years since I've seen them live.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that I can do those three things in four years though, if I take summer school, I think.
TrainSen	00001	 I came in with 36 hours of credit, so I really hope that it's possible.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to talk to my advisor about that.
TrainSen	00001	 He's really nice, his name is Lovelys.
TrainSen	00001	 He's also my FIG mentor, I am in the Business of Non-Profits FIG.
TrainSen	00001	 I've always been really interested in Non-Profit Businesses and how they run.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I'll work for a Non-Profit Business.
TrainSen	00001	 We're supposed to get guest speakers, and we're doing a Community Service project, so that will be cool.
TrainSen	00001	 Well, my time's almost up, so I'll end here.
TrainSen	00001	 Ciao.
TrainSen	00100	I'm thinking I don't know what to write This popsicle tastes good, I'm really bored, my roommate is gone I'm sitting here in a stupor, not really thinking about anything I'm thinking I miss my girlfriend and I should probably    call her when I am done with this the popsicle tastes good.
TrainSen	00100	 I hear the  bass from the stereo of person in the room next to me and I think it's  kind of annoying.
TrainSen	00100	 Tonight is going to be fun, I am looking forward to that, this popsicle is really good.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I need to clean my room, it's really messy.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to throw out the food wrappers, put my clothes away, that persons stereo is really annoying, I hear loud voices in the hall, I wonder who they are, it sounds like a cute girl, I need to put my papers and  homework away.
TrainSen	00100	 I am going to get another popsicle.
TrainSen	00100	 It tastes good too.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if a m doing this assignment correctly.
TrainSen	00100	 I am looking around my room for things to think about, but nothing really sparks any interest.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm really bored.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I will turn the radio on.
TrainSen	00100	 Never mind, I think that that might interfere with my stream of consciousness.
TrainSen	00100	 I hear one of my friends voices outside talking about the start of intramural football with somebody.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait for that to start, but I am upset that I have to play coed instead of men's.
TrainSen	00100	 This other popsicle is really good too.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel papers in my pocket and I take them out, its my bank statements.
TrainSen	00100	 That makes me upset because I see all the things I wasted my money on.
TrainSen	00100	 I throw them on the floor.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm thinking  that my time is a little over halfway done, and that makes me feel good because I am looking forward to stop typing this.
TrainSen	00100	 When I am done I think I will take a shower, and then maybe, I'm thinking about something interesting I can do after that, I'm playing racquetball at 5 so something in between that.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know, maybe I can figure something out when my roommate comes back.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm hungry.
TrainSen	00100	 Now I'm eating chips.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm laughing because I'm thinking if you actually read this one you will think I have an obsession with food, which I kind of do but that's just because I am hungry all the time.
TrainSen	00100	 I really like the chips.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm kind of sleepy too,  maybe I'll take a nap.
TrainSen	00100	 I was thinking about typing and how I am good at it and that made me think about my grandpa for some reason because he looks really silly when he types and that made me miss him because I haven't seen him in over a year.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I will call him this weekend   I love chips and salsa, it's damn good.
TrainSen	00100	 My roommate is going to be pissed because I am eating them all without him.
TrainSen	00100	 It doesn't matter though because I am really hungry.
TrainSen	00100	 2 minutes left I can't wait till this is over, its been interesting but I want to do other stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm excited though because this counts as a grade and this will be a good start for psychology class.
TrainSen	00100	 I really like these chips.
TrainSen	00100	 Well times up and now I'm really happy because I'm done.
TrainSen	00100	This is what I need to do.
TrainSen	00100	 Type with my friends in the messenger its really ADDICTING.
TrainSen	00100	 LMaoOO.
TrainSen	00100	 Well I love to listen to music.
TrainSen	00100	 Its really soothing for me and I fell weird with out it.
TrainSen	00100	 I LOVE TUTY of BRazeros Musical( ; ; my favorite group) I wonder when they are going to come back.
TrainSen	00100	 (this there one of there songs.
TrainSen	00100	 Lloviendo esta y atra vez de la lluvia te llevas con tigo a la cuidad entera mis lagrimas no miras la lluvia las confuendedn y aunque yo este llorando por mi no te preocupes.
TrainSen	00100	 Te esperare te esperare aunque no vuelas mas.
TrainSen	00100	 Llenaste mi rtecuerdos a la cuidad entera.
TrainSen	00100	 Y aunque yo se que nunca mas tu volveras.
TrainSen	00100	 "" Lagrimas y Llubia by Brazeros Musical.
TrainSen	00100	 Who did I get backstage.
TrainSen	00100	 It was all a rush.
TrainSen	00100	 But am glas I did.
TrainSen	00100	 I meet one of my favorite groups.
TrainSen	00100	 They were nice.
TrainSen	00100	 There performance was great.
TrainSen	00100	 Although at the end they stinked musty and were all sweaty they were forth it.
TrainSen	00100	 Armando and Junior were the cutest of them all.
TrainSen	00100	 I was surprised that Luis recognized me.
TrainSen	00100	 there is nothing special about me and well.
TrainSen	00100	 He was remembered how my face looked like.
TrainSen	00100	 I Hate this song put I cannot tell my roommate its from the 80s or something like that its OLD.
TrainSen	00100	 ""In the car wash.
TrainSen	00100	 "" maybe because I heard it for too long.
TrainSen	00100	 Its a remix.
TrainSen	00100	 Its lonely in my room.
TrainSen	00100	 I have nothing to do but be here in the computer.
TrainSen	00100	 Reflecting back on high school it was exciting but I wish we could've done better things to make it wonderful and more unforgettable.
TrainSen	00100	 I Made it to PROM Court.
TrainSen	00100	 I was Beaten by a girl That never attended school.
TrainSen	00100	 How can all these people that don't go to school ever always pass and get better things then me and my friends.
TrainSen	00100	 We were all great students.
TrainSen	00100	 And never broke the rules!!! Its beb 11 mins and well I have a million things tuning through my head.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my family (as whole) because they went to MEXICO with out me.
TrainSen	00100	 This the first year they do it and I feel left out.
TrainSen	00100	 But am having a blast here in the University of Texas and I cannot ask for anything better.
TrainSen	00100	 I Love Austin.
TrainSen	00100	 This were I been living for 18 years.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I love music because of this ""The Live Music Capital of the World"" music was everywhere I turned in the neighbors house, down in the drive through of McDonalds.
TrainSen	00100	 In the Laundry thing and well my mom Loves to dance.
TrainSen	00100	 Which leaves me think.
TrainSen	00100	 What am I going to do with my obsession of taking pics of different artist that come and do concert.
TrainSen	00100	 I love to meet them and makes my groups of friends grow more.
TrainSen	00100	 ""the artist"" for most part are really down to earth and I look forward to every dance there is.
TrainSen	00100	 Its Been two weeks since school started, yet our room still STINKS!!!!!! We cannot take the smell out.
TrainSen	00100	 Being in the ninth floor.
TrainSen	00100	 We cannot do much of it.
TrainSen	00100	 plus were in the middle of Nowhere land stuck in a Corner were no body comes an visit us.
TrainSen	00100	 That's good in some part because we can study and listen to music as high as we want to and none says anything.
TrainSen	00100	 Its sunny outside its not HOT like it usually is.
TrainSen	00100	 I love it when it rains but there is also going to rain.
TrainSen	00100	 That little breeze of air that vlows thriugh my hair is unbelivable.
TrainSen	00100	 I love that smell of wet grass as well.
TrainSen	00100	 UMmmmmmmmmmmm.
TrainSen	00100	 So one did PoPcoRn and I smell it all the way over here.
TrainSen	00100	 10,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 sorry I got distracted by the timer less then am done.
TrainSen	00010	I'm finally getting around to typing this stream of consciousness thing.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why I was procrastinating before, maybe hesitant because I'm subconsciously afraid of what I'd write.
TrainSen	00010	 But my dorm doesn't start its, um, food service thing for 20 minutes and I'm getting tired of uploading all my course assignments from syllabi up to Mozilla Calendar.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm already typing more coherently than I thought I was going to (caffeine, maybe? Doesn't it clear and speed up your thought process?) 1:56 already.
TrainSen	00010	 If I get to the cafeteria too early I'll have to have cereal or something just kicking around until they start preparing real food; that happened earlier today, for the first time in fact, because I ignored the Castilian Food Service schedule.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess I'm bound to forget some stuff over the long weekend, first time going back home from Austin.
TrainSen	00010	 Roommate's explaining The Facebook to suitemate right now.
TrainSen	00010	 His music used to be catchy, but he needs to get more variety.
TrainSen	00010	 I've heard Beenie Man and uhhhhh Young Buck maybe two dozen times a day, it's dumbening me.
TrainSen	00010	 I was expecting my writing to be more Ulysses-like; that's a great book: I even brought it to my dorm but haven't had time to read any of it all (not that I did at home, either) There's a guy in my intro linguistics class that looks a lot like James Joyce, down to the facial hair and everything.
TrainSen	00010	 God he's annoying, sucking up to Herr Doktor and asking questions that --- A nerf basketball just hit me.
TrainSen	00010	 Damn --questions to which the answers are overly obvious.
TrainSen	00010	 Not that I have anything against him for looking like James Joyce.
TrainSen	00010	 I picked my glasses because they looked Joycean (My dad has the same glasses as Noam Chomsky).
TrainSen	00010	 The tiny old Vietnamese woman (7:23) at my optometrists (all the employees have been Vietnamese.
TrainSen	00010	 Ong, Doan, Tran, Quach, Nguyen, &c.
TrainSen	00010	 ) said something bizarre about them making me 'look powerful'.
TrainSen	00010	 It sounded cool at the time, but in retrospect it was really creepy.
TrainSen	00010	 (8:39)  Suitemate probably thinks I'm vaguely antisocial because I'm typing furiously instead of playing Nerf basketball with him and my roommate.
TrainSen	00010	 The ball just went under my bed; there, he got it.
TrainSen	00010	 Missed it from as far back as my bed, dropped it again, shot again.
TrainSen	00010	 I was tempted to bring ummmmm not Ulysses.
TrainSen	00010	 Finnegan's Wake (no apostrophe, I remembered) up to my room, as my roommate seems not to care that I already have too lofty of literature here (I was afraid of seeming to effete if I was stuck with some anti-intellectual jock from College Station, but it's fine) but I already have enough unread books on my shelf.
TrainSen	00010	 Not that I don't intend to read it all sometime.
TrainSen	00010	 Last time I checked I was on page 168 which I think is quite far for something with almost no coherence at all.
TrainSen	00010	 Somewhere I read that Joyce revised the text continuously, making it more and more obscure and pun-filled and incoherent with each revision.
TrainSen	00010	 which would make Strauss happy.
TrainSen	00010	 It's funny what you learn from Harpers Magazine.
TrainSen	00010	 Apparently the record at shots at the Nerf basketball hoop from printer-desk range is 4.
TrainSen	00010	 Or maybe 8.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe Adam made 8 and David 4? I wasn't really paying attention, but  Ooh, my sister just signed onto AIM.
TrainSen	00010	 We need to try that Mediterranean restaurant on 24th sometime.
TrainSen	00010	 I occasionally laugh or say something noncommittal or vaguely supportive to show that I'm paying attention to their little basketball game David made 3 now.
TrainSen	00010	 Adam's trying from distance, missed.
TrainSen	00010	 Standing right next to me, apparently I'm 3 point range.
TrainSen	00010	 When I grow up I bet I'll have to patronize my kids similarly.
TrainSen	00010	 16:14 I can eat before too terribly long, then I'll have to read for history and such and add this class to mozilla calendar  David just backed into me.
TrainSen	00010	 Ewww This 50 cent song is so violent.
TrainSen	00010	 At first I thought it was catchy, but really it's just creepy.
TrainSen	00010	 17:41  He's putting the Onion volume 14 back on my shelf, upside down.
TrainSen	00010	 They're leaving for dinner, asked me if I wanted to come, explained psych writing assignment.
TrainSen	00010	 He doesn't think he like's quesadillas.
TrainSen	00010	 They're ok, but I prefer them without too much stuff in them.
TrainSen	00010	 Which they always have, except that it's the do-it-yourself line which should remedy that.
TrainSen	00010	 So I'll be down in a few seconds.
TrainSen	00010	 unless the elevators take too long which they do.
TrainSen	00010	 What else.
TrainSen	00010	 AIM.
TrainSen	00010	 Got my course packets today.
TrainSen	00010	 IT was easier to find but Abel's I had to search for.
TrainSen	00100	Well.
TrainSen	00100	 Actually, I don not know what should I write down here.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that this can be a very easy assignment, or this can be a very hard assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 How stupid! Honestly, today, I asked about it to a TA because I could not totally understand what should I do? I knew that there is no topic, but no topic can mean the huge categories.
TrainSen	00100	 Anyway, this assignment made me confused.
TrainSen	00100	 But, interestingly, a American student asked about what she should do for the assignment in the today's class.
TrainSen	00100	 At that time, I thought two.
TrainSen	00100	 One is that there is also a person who do not understand the purpose of this assignment like me.
TrainSen	00100	 And.
TrainSen	00100	 the other is that ""Oh, my god! Don't ask me.
TrainSen	00100	 Don't ask me.
TrainSen	00100	 Because I am an international student who came here in America a month ago.
TrainSen	00100	 So.
TrainSen	00100	 I am not good at listening to what people say yet, especially in the casual conversation.
TrainSen	00100	 You know, young American university students talk so fast.
TrainSen	00100	 Hum~~~ it is a big problem.
TrainSen	00100	 So, I made her ask the same question three times, and finally, I could tell her what she should do for this assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 How stupid!! Now.
TrainSen	00100	 I am in a big dilemma.
TrainSen	00100	 I have a difficulty keeping up with classes now, but I feel happy and can relax when I meet friends and drink with them.
TrainSen	00100	 But, I have to study.
TrainSen	00100	 So, I thought that now, I have to meet lots of friends to learn English instead of only studying in the library to keep up with classes.
TrainSen	00100	 I thinks it is a great excuse to play.
TrainSen	00100	 But, what is the priority for me?? Meeting friends to learn English and American culture? Or studying hard to keep up with all classes with no meeting others?? So difficult!! However, I suddenly wonder.
TrainSen	00100	 Can I deal with both of them perfectly.
TrainSen	00100	 .
TrainSen	00100	 .
TrainSen	00100	 .
TrainSen	00100	 ?? So confused.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow, time is almost over.
TrainSen	00100	 but, I do not much.
TrainSen	00100	 36.
TrainSen	00100	 37.
TrainSen	00100	 38.
TrainSen	00100	 .
TrainSen	00100	 .
TrainSen	00100	 44.
TrainSen	10000	I finally got to see Matrix: Revolutions.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know what everyone was talking about, saying it was awful.
TrainSen	10000	 It's funny, everyone I've talked to that loved the 2nd one hated the 3rd one and everyone that hated the 2nd one loved the 3rd one.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm in the latter category.
TrainSen	10000	 I've been thinking about why this is the case for a long while now.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it might have to do with our expectations.
TrainSen	10000	 I loved the first one.
TrainSen	10000	 I was waiting for the second one to come out ever since I heard they were making a trilogy.
TrainSen	10000	 I had good expectations for Reloaded, and I went to the theatre to see it on opening night and I was disappointed.
TrainSen	10000	 The interesting thing is that about a month earlier, X-Men 2 came out.
TrainSen	10000	 I liked the first one a lot, but I wasn't waiting with bated breath for the 2nd one to come out (like how it was with Reloaded).
TrainSen	10000	 My expectations were, shall we say, nonexistent.
TrainSen	10000	 I hadn't given it a lot of thought about what to expect.
TrainSen	10000	 When I went to that movie theatre to see it, it blew me away.
TrainSen	10000	 After about an hour and a half had gone by, I checked my friend's watch because I was worried the movie would end soon.
TrainSen	10000	         Enough Matrix talk.
TrainSen	10000	 I just got back from Vegas, and I got to see David Copperfield.
TrainSen	10000	 Hmmm.
TrainSen	10000	 It might be interesting to look at what he does from a psychological researcher's standpoint, being an ""illusionist"" and all.
TrainSen	10000	 I saw through one of his tricks, though it might have been due to the fact that I'm very proficient in visual media.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it might be because I've seen all of those Goddamned behind the scenes ""documentary"" stuff for the extended versions of Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.
TrainSen	10000	 In a way it's kind of spoiled the tricks that movie makers use.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe it would have been better to remain ignorant and enjoy movies strictly on the visual surface.
TrainSen	10000	 I had a point to this.
TrainSen	10000	 Copperfield.
TrainSen	10000	 Yeah, it was fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I found it interesting that his show used a lot of technological ""illusions.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  What I mean by that is that he used a lot of video footage or complex audio and video queues in the show.
TrainSen	10000	 Again, it might've been better if I had remained ignorant of how simple it was to do some of his tricks.
TrainSen	10000	 The older audience members must have been stumped.
TrainSen	10000	          Kenji's very cute.
TrainSen	10000	 He's finally decided to settle down for the, oh, I don't know.
TrainSen	10000	 Next hour at the most.
TrainSen	10000	  Whenever I'm on the computer, he tends to sleep on my CD book so that he can still be close to me, but he's chosen a different spot.
TrainSen	10000	 Instead of being directly to the right of me, he's directly to the left of me.
TrainSen	10000	 Big difference!  Before I'd moved the computer onto where it is now, I had it closer to the bed on Ryan's desk.
TrainSen	10000	 Ken would spend most of his time while I was on the computer on the corner of my bed.
TrainSen	10000	 Er, sorry.
TrainSen	10000	 AMANDA'S bed.
TrainSen	10000	 I still can't get over the time when I talked to her (a very rare time since the Kerry people have been working her little ass of ever since she moved out and I took her old apartment) and I was so excited that I'd bought this silky linen for, and I quote, ""my bed.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  ""You mean MY bed,"" she said.
TrainSen	10000	 ""I bought it.
TrainSen	10000	 You're only keeping the things in that apartment while I'm gone working on the campaign.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  Bullshit.
TrainSen	10000	 When we were kids, do you think we would go around saying to are friends, ""Oh, I have to go now.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to go to my mom's bed.
TrainSen	10000	 or what I should call my mom's bed, because she bought it even though I sleep in it every night.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  Yeesh!  She's just being possessive because she really likes to identify herself as being financially independent.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope she'll get over it, because I really resent the fact that she believes I'm supposed to look around all the furniture in this apartment as hers.
TrainSen	10000	 For some reason that really bugs me.
TrainSen	10000	 Ken's awake and about now.
TrainSen	10000	 It's making it difficult to type now, because he's trying to claw the keyboard while I'm typing.
TrainSen	01000	well since I have this assignment in front of me it is obviously the first thing I am thinking about.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if the fact that I have been thinking about doing this assignment will affect what I write down.
TrainSen	01000	 it probably will.
TrainSen	01000	 like, I knew this would happen.
TrainSen	01000	 I was thinking as soon as we got the assignment that sex is always on my mind and since this is college, I think it will be ok to mention it.
TrainSen	01000	 my back itches.
TrainSen	01000	 I got a sunburn yesterday at the beach.
TrainSen	01000	 I knew I probably should have put sunscreen on, but I am a procrastinator, so I never got around to it.
TrainSen	01000	 I kept asking my girlfriend if my back was burning yet, and she kept saying ""no"", but I guess she couldn't really tell how bad it was.
TrainSen	01000	 my roommate just asked me what we had to read for this class.
TrainSen	01000	 I haven't really been keeping up with my reading lately.
TrainSen	01000	 I skipped class today also just because I didn't feel like waking up on time.
TrainSen	01000	 my girlfriend probably is not as smart as me, but most of the time she seems like she works harder than me.
TrainSen	01000	 when we first started going out she never used to get mad at me for anything.
TrainSen	01000	 now she is always getting mad at me for everything.
TrainSen	01000	 she used to laugh when ever I would get lost driving around because I have a bad sense of directions, but now she just always yells at me and says ""where the fuck are you going"".
TrainSen	01000	 I never get mad at her for things she does to me though.
TrainSen	01000	 I have infinite almost patience with her.
TrainSen	01000	 she lost a piece to a puzzle I have had since I was like 2 and all I did was tell her not to worry about it but when ever I do something small like step on her sandal at the mall she gets really pissed off and says ""fuck Eric, watch where the fuck your going, that fucking the second time you've done that shit"".
TrainSen	01000	 I wish she was not always like that but I still love her very much.
TrainSen	01000	 we've been together for nearly a year now so I am pretty sure we can last if we want to.
TrainSen	01000	 I have economics to do.
TrainSen	10000	So I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing with this.
TrainSen	10000	 just typing I guess.
TrainSen	10000	 Damn aim.
TrainSen	10000	 No one ever wants to instant message me until I start doing something.
TrainSen	10000	 There are so many times when I am just sitting here playing on the computer and doing nothing really, and no one wants to talk.
TrainSen	10000	 The minute I start doing something productive, there is like five people trying to talk to me at once.
TrainSen	10000	 All that typing and its only been two minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 I have no idea what to type.
TrainSen	10000	 Can your mind really go blank?  I mean, I want to use the expression right now, my mind is blank, because I'm not really thinking about anything, but obviously I'm thinking about something because I am typing this stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 So my mind really isn't blank then.
TrainSen	10000	 So I guess your mind doesn't really ever go blank.
TrainSen	10000	 My roommate is funny.
TrainSen	10000	 I keep picturing her when I walked in the door from class earlier.
TrainSen	10000	 She was asleep on the couch but she had the pillow on her face.
TrainSen	10000	 How someone can sleep with a pillow on their face is beyond me.
TrainSen	10000	 Its looked so funny though.
TrainSen	10000	 I should have took a picture.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm really sleepy already and its only going to be seven o'clock in the evening.
TrainSen	10000	 I am still not used to this getting up early for class stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 Ah.
TrainSen	10000	 The new real world is on tonight.
TrainSen	10000	 I absolutely love watching that show.
TrainSen	10000	 All the drama.
TrainSen	10000	 Its interesting to watch.
TrainSen	10000	 Its kind of sad though I think, the way people love to watch reality shows.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean, they are not really a true picture of reality.
TrainSen	10000	 They film for hours and hours and hours, but the show itself is usually only a half hour episode, and they usually only run for a few months, once a week.
TrainSen	10000	 Can u imagine how much film ends up on the ""cutting room floor"" as they call it.
TrainSen	10000	 All the drama and stuff is pretty much made up by producers if you think about it.
TrainSen	10000	 If not made up completely at least embellished.
TrainSen	10000	 And its all because of editing.
TrainSen	10000	 Birthday.
TrainSen	10000	 Someone on TV just said the word birthday.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm so excited.
TrainSen	10000	 My birthday is a week from tomorrow.
TrainSen	10000	 Yeah!  but I also have my dad's birthday next week and my boyfriend's too.
TrainSen	10000	 And I have no idea what to get them.
TrainSen	10000	 Actually what to get my boyfriend.
TrainSen	10000	 My dad is easy.
TrainSen	10000	 A gift certificate for tools or golf stuff and he is happy.
TrainSen	10000	 My boyfriend.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know.
TrainSen	10000	 He already has plenty of cologne (did I spell that right?) so I don't want to get him that.
TrainSen	10000	 And I always buy him clothes.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to get him something different this time but I have no idea what.
TrainSen	10000	 And he is going to be 21.
TrainSen	10000	 Lucky.
TrainSen	10000	 Everyone is leaving me behind.
TrainSen	10000	 I am the youngest of a lot  of my friends.
TrainSen	10000	 So now they can all go out to the bars.
TrainSen	10000	 Without me.
TrainSen	10000	 So sad.
TrainSen	10000	 I still have a whole year to go.
TrainSen	10000	 Bleh I hate waiting.
TrainSen	10000	 Bleh.
TrainSen	10000	 Is that a word? I type it a lot on aim.
TrainSen	10000	 Its my way to say yucky or boring or I don't know.
TrainSen	10000	 I heard it from somewhere though.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't remember where.
TrainSen	10000	 Ha-ha.
TrainSen	10000	 My roommate is up.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if she knows she was sleeping with a pillow on her face.
TrainSen	10000	 Because it fell off when I came in.
TrainSen	10000	 Bleh.
TrainSen	10000	 I am not looking forward to waking up early tomorrow again.
TrainSen	10000	 I think we should have a fall break.
TrainSen	10000	 kind of like spring break.
TrainSen	10000	 I need my rest.
TrainSen	10000	 Its only the third week of school and I'm already so exhausted.
TrainSen	10000	 I need a break.
TrainSen	10000	So school has been interesting so far.
TrainSen	10000	 I've come into this with preconceived notions of what it was going to be like, and I've surprised myself to find that it would be completely different.
TrainSen	10000	 At the time, I have become increasingly known by a nickname that wasn't even self imposed, I've created a superficial personality that people associate with and attach themselves to.
TrainSen	10000	 People love ""dat Boi Tony"" but hey.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I'm not too mad about it.
TrainSen	10000	 it's good in the end, in some ways, and in some ways not.
TrainSen	10000	 like for example, if I want people to know who I am, then they really do know who I am, and the introductory part of conversation is out of the way, but on the other hand, since people think they know who I am they won't bother to finish out the conversation and actually get to know who I am.
TrainSen	10000	 really who am I anyway?  can it be defined by a label or name?  does it matter if I am Anthony Derrell Williams, Tony, or Dat Boi Tony.
TrainSen	10000	 because some people can remember my name at all.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess in some facets it really is irrelevant, but nobody really wants to be considered irrelevant.
TrainSen	10000	 lol.
TrainSen	10000	 it's like significance drives us, like a since of purpose, much like Agent Smith from the Matrix, but that movie was flawed in itself.
TrainSen	10000	 It had no purpose.
TrainSen	10000	 It started out as a great action flick that wanted to mean something in the end,  but that just didn't work.
TrainSen	10000	 However Quentin Tarentino, did it right when I he made Kill Bill,  it was a simple plot with a unique character development, and that was the important part.
TrainSen	10000	 many people thought that it was the action, but it truly was the characters that made the movie.
TrainSen	10000	 that's why vol.
TrainSen	10000	 2 is better than vol.
TrainSen	10000	 1, no matter what the next person tells you.
TrainSen	10000	 sure vol.
TrainSen	10000	 1 was composed of the best action sequences since the old Bruce Lee days (who is still better than Jackie Chan and Jet Li), but the story itself is what should draw you.
TrainSen	10000	 on another note, a friend of mine has been dealing with several issues and decided he would post his thoughts and troubles on the internet for everybody to see, and now he's getting chewed out by a lot of people because nobody really has it in their hearts to really care.
TrainSen	10000	 The problem here really is that he thinks he is opening his mind, but he really has closed the port and he has yet to mature.
TrainSen	10000	 he can't take in new ideas or criticisms to better himself, the thinks he is fine as who he is.
TrainSen	10000	 Emo SUX though.
TrainSen	10000	 I had no formulated opinion about it until I seen what it is doing to him.
TrainSen	10000	 he needs help.
TrainSen	10000	 for real.
TrainSen	10000	 the funniest part about it, is that my friend ended his cruel convo with him by quoting Nietzsche.
TrainSen	10000	 ""God is Dead.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  which is a very interesting quote.
TrainSen	10000	 a statement made just to test the bounds of control that the state held on the people thought their interpretation of religion.
TrainSen	10000	 if the person blindly tries to refute the statement without the use of reason.
TrainSen	10000	 they are a tool, if they inject reason and use logic to prove why God is alive.
TrainSen	10000	 then they are less of one.
TrainSen	10000	 the point is, that the religious texts, such as the Koran, the Bible, etc.
TrainSen	10000	 were written by man (inspired by God), which means they are subject to flaws.
TrainSen	10000	 inherently and maybe intentionally,   if you could tell the people ""thus said the lord"" and you didn't want them to kill or steal or eat shellfish.
TrainSen	10000	 then that's what you'd tell them.
TrainSen	10000	 after all some people read from texts translated by Shakespeare.
TrainSen	10000	 but I digress.
TrainSen	10000	 I as a Christian would only have this much to say in return.
TrainSen	10000	 if God is dead then that is irrefutable evidence to the fact that he existed.
TrainSen	10000	 And if he truly is God and did exist,  Death has no binding power.
TrainSen	10000	 defining death would then become the point and focus of reason and logic.
TrainSen	10000	 What is death, what is death to a man, what is death to a beast, what is death to a god.
TrainSen	10000	 And then I would say.
TrainSen	10000	 yes, God in the form of man (Jesus) did die, for you and I.
TrainSen	10000	 there's always a way to explain something in the logical realm, however some people are too closed minded to see even that.
TrainSen	10000	 Sometimes, philosophy, even pomo philosophy, can be used to solidify faith because it makes somebody question themselves and why the believe what they believe.
TrainSen	10000	 and if the answers to the self examination are satisfactory.
TrainSen	10000	 that persons faith has become that much stronger.
TrainSen	10000	 Well.
TrainSen	10000	 yester I went to a labor day cookout.
TrainSen	10000	 and there were some fine ladies there.
TrainSen	10000	 You never notice how good somebody looks until they try to look good for you.
TrainSen	10000	 that's the funny part about it all, I don't try that hard enough.
TrainSen	10000	 I just wonder what other people's perception is of me.
TrainSen	10000	 could I have had a chance with any of those girls, probably, but not likely.
TrainSen	10000	 and this is where my reckoning begins.
TrainSen	10000	 what are these girls looking for.
TrainSen	10000	 attention? relationships?  or just good sex?   I could provide them with all 3, but hey there's only a small amount of me to go around.
TrainSen	10000	 all jokes aside, with the truth being told, I really think attention is the centric thing that girls want.
TrainSen	10000	 how they translate different actions to be attention is a different story, because girls are all so different.
TrainSen	10000	 but all so much the same when the picture is generalized and magnified to show detail.
TrainSen	10000	 and I like to look at detail.
TrainSen	10000	 that's why I think I might be staying single for a while.
TrainSen	10000	 even as hard as that is in a place like UT Austin.
TrainSen	10000	Oh damn!  Wednesday was awesome! please give me some water.
TrainSen	10000	 My  friends are funny and so is this movie the brain is really cool with all its disorders  and shit for the love my friends are so sarcastic but I love it and I do it too damn I  need to stop smoking I'm like a chimney they joke about killing themselves which  is really funny because  i9 no they're joking I'm normally a good writer damn sorry.
TrainSen	10000	 the  critic is awesome and my professor is so fucking funny I lived in midland too for  awhile cool I'm a psychology major I need gum can I have some.
TrainSen	10000	 Sweet I got some.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm not suicidal or anything so don't worry I just sneezed and it hurt I hope I don't  wake up my roommate this late I'm tired it seems like all my professors smoke weed.
TrainSen	10000	 tight! anyways puppies hahahaha anyway I miss my dog and my dead cat I have  ocd not surprising I think its genetic but my mom wont admit it and I just realized  how much I love them because I could imagine them at my age and relate I almost  feel sorry for being so hard on them almost hahahaha I'm hungry I'm good at  Spanish TACO C sweet! please help me! just joking again.
TrainSen	10000	 god damn this is so  fucking long oohh sexual stimulation like the rat that was so funny the astros suck  dave chappelle rox ooooowwwww shit! that hurt.
TrainSen	10000	 whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 the simpsons sweet  ummm sleep balh blah balh blah blah I can't think my friends are heavy wow I miss  my friend in the air force he says it sux : ( like that insert I like my linguistics class  this is all bullshit and so is life.
TrainSen	10000	 why are we here? oohh too clich� sorry I'm im I'm im  I'm   I'm im I'm im I'm whatever ""because this is my united states of whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't mind  bush or Kerry.
TrainSen	10000	 they're both right.
TrainSen	10000	 but I don't see why shit I forgot oh people in Austin  are so liberal to the point of offense.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe I'm blind (not literally) sigh puke? no  pee oh.
TrainSen	10000	 I love the graduate and Donnie darko is my favorite movie ever but I  actually saw it when it first came out I like I like I like I like maybe its a hotel sorry  took a brake oh I think I can actually relate a lot to the movie because my family is  just like that children with problems with drugs (psychiatric or other) in a wealthy  family with the money craved superficial mom and many marriages on either side  and divorce with children all over the place and step dad lawyer asshole.
TrainSen	01000	my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty/sweaty boy.
TrainSen	01000	 I came over to his apt to do this homework.
TrainSen	01000	 and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves.
TrainSen	01000	 I am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm usually a really fast typer, because I've had a computer for a long time.
TrainSen	01000	 my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house.
TrainSen	01000	 he wanted me to do computer science and I did as well, but when I came to UT I found out it is totally wrong for me.
TrainSen	01000	 I just switched to retail merchandising and I'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than CS was.
TrainSen	01000	 I think its funny how older people(no offense) are not really connected to the computer.
TrainSen	01000	 the computer, can do so many wonderful things, I can't even see my life without one.
TrainSen	01000	 don't think I'm a dork just because I said I was in CS, but take for example doing this homework online.
TrainSen	01000	 its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it.
TrainSen	01000	 it was a very easy/simple task.
TrainSen	01000	 that's amazing.
TrainSen	01000	 they said that my generation will spend like 12 years of there life online and I believe it.
TrainSen	01000	 there is just so much to do online.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I might be typing bad, but I'd like you to excuse that.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder what you actually look for in these type of things, how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean I'd hate to see what you think of me now, but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true.
TrainSen	01000	 so I totally love Paris Hilton, she is such a riot.
TrainSen	01000	 I think its funny people don't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show.
TrainSen	01000	 but I wont get into that, however she came out with a new book.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to read it, I think it will be amusing.
TrainSen	01000	 on a side note, I'm not really sure why I'm eating cheetos, I don't really like them, just every now and then I crave them.
TrainSen	01000	 I absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling.
TrainSen	01000	 I just   dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in  your teeth.
TrainSen	01000	 I really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself.
TrainSen	01000	 I never realized 20 minutes would feel like so long.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe because I'm starving and I just want to go eat and go to tops, it feels like that.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate that.
TrainSen	01000	 how are you suppose to do something  that feels like eternity.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go.
TrainSen	01000	 I was going to do it earlier but I was having a hard time getting the pre-screening thing to work.
TrainSen	01000	 then once I did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless.
TrainSen	01000	 you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with, because its so freaking slow.
TrainSen	01000	 I still have to go back and finish that and I dread it.
TrainSen	01000	 however, I think my boyfriend is entertained now because I can here he is playing playstation two in the next room.
TrainSen	01000	 gosh I'm so hungry and this is taking way to long.
TrainSen	01000	 I have now moved on to goldfish to eat.
TrainSen	01000	 speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating.
TrainSen	01000	 wow.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel bad that so many people have eating disorders, I know quite a few.
TrainSen	01000	 so many things for girls to be stressed about.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all.
TrainSen	01000	 they think its all just food related.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate how little kids are so fat today.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish people would help teach kids how to eat.
TrainSen	01000	 they let them eat ANYTHING.
TrainSen	01000	 they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise.
TrainSen	01000	 or they don't set the example themselves.
TrainSen	01000	 my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 1 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done ALL their homework and their daily chore.
TrainSen	01000	 then they also get a snack  sized candy (the little bitty bite size) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat.
TrainSen	01000	 then there are kids who drink like 8 cokes a day.
TrainSen	01000	 crazy crazy.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy.
TrainSen	01000	 we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music.
TrainSen	01000	 its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't imagine it not being computer timed.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't imagine being the person who reads all this crap.
TrainSen	01000	 it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important?  that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail.
TrainSen	01000	 but that could happen anywhere I guess.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm so hungry its not funny.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm glad I don't have to pee or anything that would just suck.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like my mind is going blank because I'm so bored.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this.
TrainSen	01000	 it would be easy.
TrainSen	01000	 gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top doesn't have any numbers.
TrainSen	01000	 like its keeping time per say.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm quitting this at 4 o'clock even if this thing doesn't stop itself because I know I'll be over the time if I wait till 4 so you can't cut my grade cause your thing didn't work.
TrainSen	01000	 oh crap this clock is fast so I'll quit like 8 min before 4 and that should be even.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I started this at 3:30 hmmmmmm I can't really remember.
TrainSen	01000	 damn it.
TrainSen	01000	 this sucks ass.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't see how this is helping you.
TrainSen	01000	 just making me get annoyed because I don't know when I started so i dont know when I can end and just go on with my life.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like this is pointless and I'm past my typing time.
TrainSen	01000	 I have no concept of time, but I don't know if anyone really does.
TrainSen	01000	 just depends on what they are doing or what's going on around them and etc.
TrainSen	01000	 time is a funny thing.
TrainSen	01000	 more goldfish to cure my growling stomach/boredom.
TrainSen	01000	 ouch I just kicked the computer or something underneath me.
TrainSen	01000	 and it hurt.
TrainSen	01000	 to bad I'm not on my computer cause then I could be laying in bed doing this.
TrainSen	01000	 wireless and laptops.
TrainSen	01000	 genius.
TrainSen	01000	 the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 3 minutes and counting.
TrainSen	01000	 3:55 will be the new time for completion.
TrainSen	01000	 3 more minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 and I'm stumped.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know what to type/talk about.
TrainSen	01000	 ooooooo 2 minutes and counting.
TrainSen	01000	 ok randomness:  I am not sure what I'm going to do tonight, I might go to a party or something, however I'm not going to dress up really cause I'm just feeling a chill vibe.
TrainSen	01000	 0ne minute.
TrainSen	01000	 .
TrainSen	01000	 and probably have a few drinks, or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend.
TrainSen	01000	 sweet guy.
TrainSen	01000	 not sure we are completely on the same page, but we have years for that to develop.
TrainSen	01000	 .
TrainSen	01000	 Times up.
TrainSen	00010	So this is the third time that I have tried to do this for some reason my computer is having some problems this morning.
TrainSen	00010	 Explorer crashed and so I had to reboot my machine which can take a while.
TrainSen	00010	 It's amazing how slow PC's get after you install Anti-Virus software.
TrainSen	00010	 In the process of it rebooting I went and made a cup of coffee.
TrainSen	00010	 Bavarian Hazlenut form HEB, delicious.
TrainSen	00010	 So I was thinking about this assignment and how it was similar to an assignment I took in a Humanities class a while back.
TrainSen	00010	 They asked us to spend 20 minutes alone somewhere, anywhere just thinking about anything and making notes.
TrainSen	00010	 I spent it in the campus parking lot, a wide open space, fairly peaceful, trees swaying in the summer breeze and began making notes, not really sure of the purpose.
TrainSen	00010	 After the 20 minutes was up I realized that I was much more in tune with all of my senses than at the start.
TrainSen	00010	 Normally I would walk around just using the sense that were needed, sight, hearing and focused on coordination, driving, etc.
TrainSen	00010	 During the 20 minute period in the parking lot I became aware much more of my sense of touch, the feel of the paper I was writing on, the smell of my surroundings, the movement of the trees as they swayed in the breeze, I've mentioned that twice now, what does that mean?  I just finished my first cup of coffee.
TrainSen	00010	 My apologies about my spelling.
TrainSen	00010	 I have a tendency to just type first and ask questions about my spelling later.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know how this app handles me jumping back to correct spelling.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope I'm not confusing it.
TrainSen	00010	 Probably not.
TrainSen	00010	 A thought of sunny beaches just jumped into my head for no reason.
TrainSen	00010	 South Padre on a breezy summer evening.
TrainSen	00010	 Again this breeze thing, what's with that?  In fact I'm thinking about the breeze that may be outside right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I just went out to feed the cats and it was cool and a little breeze was in the air.
TrainSen	00010	 Perhaps I need to go outside when I'm done here and soak it up.
TrainSen	00010	 It's like a vitamin that the body is lacking, eventually you crave something that subconsciously you know gives you that vitamin.
TrainSen	00010	 For some reason , perhaps I didn't get out enough at the weekend, I need to feel the breeze.
TrainSen	00010	  Central Market,  I have a coupon to Central Market sitting in front of me.
TrainSen	00010	 I like that place and apparently if I go there this week and spend $30 or more then I can get $10 off rib-eye steaks.
TrainSen	00010	 The fan spins slowly overhead, a gentle clicking, a low hum,  the sound of my typing and then, silence.
TrainSen	00010	 Why are keyboards so awkward.
TrainSen	00010	 Isn't there a better way to do this.
TrainSen	00010	 Surely a Psychologist somewhere has studied this and come up with something, more ergonomic.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm thinking about my brother.
TrainSen	00010	 I just spent 2.
TrainSen	00010	 5 months in the U.
TrainSen	00010	 K.
TrainSen	00010	 during the Summer working for him, selling.
TrainSen	00010	 They are a web services company.
TrainSen	00010	 He is the owner and a good guy.
TrainSen	00010	 He is the glue that keeps many things together.
TrainSen	00010	 He has 3 kids who are all precious.
TrainSen	00010	 One has a spine problem and can't walk.
TrainSen	00010	 That unfortunately is the extent of my knowledge.
TrainSen	00010	 English people are strange in that they make it hard to communicate simple things to each other.
TrainSen	00010	 They do things that they think are right but in fact are completely wrong.
TrainSen	00010	 I got attacked while I was in the U.
TrainSen	00010	 K.
TrainSen	00010	 In the street at 8:30 in the morning on Friday the 13th.
TrainSen	00010	 I was on my way to work and got attacked.
TrainSen	00010	 The Police there are awful.
TrainSen	00010	 They just don't care.
TrainSen	00010	 They are nowhere to be found.
TrainSen	00010	 In the most obvious situations where you would think they would be they hide and when you least need them they are there to hassle you.
TrainSen	00010	 I have not been hassled but they are that kind of personality.
TrainSen	00010	 Just my impression.
TrainSen	00010	 Power hungry wimps.
TrainSen	00010	 No idea for the big picture, just CYA and demonstrate what little power you have.
TrainSen	00010	 Why can't they quantities the biggest problems and formulate a response and go about resolving it.
TrainSen	00010	 Did you know that England has now clearly taken over the spot of the capitol for drunks in Europe.
TrainSen	00010	 The British government will be introducing laws next year to combat the problem.
TrainSen	00010	 Why do they not have a public intoxication law now????  You can be drunk in the street hassling old ladies and get away with it while the police stand by and chat to one another!!!!  Well my time is almost up in fact a notice just came up.
TrainSen	00010	 Time to go.
TrainSen	00010	 Hope this has not been boring.
TrainSen	00010	 Have a great day.
TrainSen	00100	I don't know why, but for some reason I am extremely nervous about this writing  assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 It most likely won't even be read! Random, but I started thinking  about what an awful driver I am in Austin.
TrainSen	00100	 All of the one way streets and stop  signs that people don't stop at are very overwhelming.
TrainSen	00100	 I've already ran two red  lights.
TrainSen	00100	 whoops.
TrainSen	00100	 Since this writing assignment is online, I can't help but read the  instant messages that pop up while I'm typing.
TrainSen	00100	 I love talking to people online, I  think I'm addicted.
TrainSen	00100	 It really is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family  now that we are all living in different cities.
TrainSen	00100	 Especially since two of my best friends  are still in high school and my younger sister is a freshman in high school, I can talk  to them all at the same time.
TrainSen	00100	 It is very convenient.
TrainSen	00100	 Since coming to college I have  become obsessed with downloading music from itunes.
TrainSen	00100	 Tomorrow night the Sig  Eps are having an 80's theme party, so last night I spent about an hour  downloading hit songs from the 80's.
TrainSen	00100	 My friends and I are going to have a pre- dance party in my dorm room.
TrainSen	00100	 It will be awesome.
TrainSen	00100	 Today my friend Melanie and I  went shopping at thrift stores to find 80's garb.
TrainSen	00100	 I found the best 80's pumps for only  six dollars.
TrainSen	00100	 Can you say jackpot?  I think my favorite 80's song right now has to be  Jessie's Girl by Rick Springstein.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I was Jessie's girl, because then I would  date his best friend.
TrainSen	00100	 Speaking of dating, I think dating in college is going to be  rather difficult considering there are approximately 50 gorgeous girls on campus  to every one attractive guy.
TrainSen	00100	 Not that looks are everything, but that is what  generally draws two people together to start talking.
TrainSen	00100	 Actually I think that is usually  the case, but I am definitely drawn to the shy awkward boys as opposed to the  attractive hard asses.
TrainSen	00100	 Racquetball is my new favorite sport.
TrainSen	00100	 I have played five times since I've been  here.
TrainSen	00100	 It's really the best work out.
TrainSen	00100	 It's so much better than running for 20 minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 just play racquetball for 45 minutes and you can't breath.
TrainSen	00100	 It's such a great feeling.
TrainSen	00100	 I have had a few complaints though, because I tend to accidentally hit the person I  am playing with a little too often than necessary.
TrainSen	00100	 I've hit my sister like twice and I  couldn't even guess how many times I've hit Christy.
TrainSen	00100	 Whoops! I love going to concerts.
TrainSen	00100	 They are probably on my top 5 favorite things to do list,  along with snowboarding, eating, sleeping, and dancing.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish we had some  snow nearby, but I would hate to live in the cold so I guess I don't really want snow  close by.
TrainSen	00100	 I almost went to school in Boulder, Colorado but I realized I would have  to wear about 5 layers of clothing just to walk to class and I decided it just wasn't  worth it.
TrainSen	00100	 I am a Texan, if I didn't break a sweat between classes I don't know what I  would do with myself.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait to take trips over the holidays with my new  college friends.
TrainSen	00001	wow I just turned on my music a little too loud.
TrainSen	00001	 that really scared me for a second.
TrainSen	00001	 let's get this straightened out a bit I'm so glad I'm listening to this cd it reminds me of Chris, who I miss terribly at the moment.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder why he didn't call me back last night well I guess it was really late and he probably had stuff to do, his chemistry homework and stuff like that.
TrainSen	00001	 I think it's really funny that his roommate's name is hank and he's Chinese, that's just funny.
TrainSen	00001	 my feet are really cold even though I have on socks and my slippers I guess it's just that I always get really cold in hardin house I don't know why they keep it like a refrigerator in here.
TrainSen	00001	 everything's going to be alright, rockabye.
TrainSen	00001	 I like this song a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 all her friends tell her she's so pretty, she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while.
TrainSen	00001	 so Fiji has a foam party planned for tomorrow night and I think that's going to be a lot of fun, except I don't know, the thought of being in a room of foam really freaks me out.
TrainSen	00001	 I get really claustrophobic, especially when I feel like I can't breathe, kind of like when I go to sleep and I like to pull the covers up over me but I always have to make sure there's a way for a lot of air to get in and out because otherwise it just freaks me out.
TrainSen	00001	 anyways, I think it'll be fun but I'm not sure if I'm going to get in the whole way.
TrainSen	00001	 I've been in a whiteout once, that one in beaver creek or wait no it was park city and that was so scary, I kind of think this would be like that except a lot closer and like in your face, and hopefully not as cold.
TrainSen	00001	 though part of what makes me claustrophobic is when you get all hot and everything as well as not being able to breathe, like you feel like you can't get any fresh air like a breeze or anything.
TrainSen	00001	 but I still really want to go in just for a minute to say I've done it.
TrainSen	00001	 but Leila was telling me about how people like do stuff in the foam, and I don't know I'm worried because mark is a Fiji which makes me kind of not want to go over there I wonder why he's been telling his friends about me I really don't like that because I really don't like him and I know he likes me but he's kind of crazy and obsessive almost, though he's really nice, it just seems like he tries way too hard.
TrainSen	00001	 like too hard to be so interested in your conversation and be listening and just making that ""hmmmmmm.
TrainSen	00001	 interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 "" like too pleasant psychologist kind of face that makes me think he's like analyzing everything I say, like I sound stupid but he's just not saying anything kind thing.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know I just really don't like that at all.
TrainSen	00001	 and I think he's a little gay.
TrainSen	00001	 well maybe not gay, but definitely metro.
TrainSen	00001	 I think it's really funny that I've spelled definitely my whole life, and it's always been wrong but I just can't retrain myself to get it right.
TrainSen	00001	 kind of like weird or weird.
TrainSen	00001	 I still get them mixed up because I know I used to always write it one way and it was wrong, but now I don't know which way is right because I can never remember if I ever actually fixed it or not.
TrainSen	00001	 I think it's weird.
TrainSen	00001	 weird.
TrainSen	00001	 whatever.
TrainSen	00001	 weird.
TrainSen	00001	 that looks a lot more right than the other way so hey we're going to go with that.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know what I think about will.
TrainSen	00001	 he's also a Fiji, so if I go to foam I get to see him but I also have to deal with mark, so that's kind of like a double-edged-sword-damned if you do damned if you don't situation.
TrainSen	00001	 I got sick of the hyphens.
TrainSen	00001	 anyways, I think he's a really sweet guy and all, but he's just so quiet! but at the same time it's like I'm drawn to him almost because he's a dry pledge and he's cute but not all at the same time, I'm sick of this song and I'm changing it this one is happier but back to will I just don't know what I think of him.
TrainSen	00001	 or that.
TrainSen	00001	 whatever.
TrainSen	00001	 I am leaving cause I love you, I am leaving cause I don't and I'm hoping you will follow and I'm praying that you won't let me go.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to know who sings this song, Chris never told me.
TrainSen	00001	 I still can't believe he made me all those cds on the night he left it was really fun to talk to bo yesterday, I really liked talking to him he seemed so lonely and desperate to talk to someone his own age.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss bo.
TrainSen	00001	 I could never tell if he really liked me or not, kind of like Travis, because it always seemed like we had the same kind of conversation every time, like hey bo how you doing I'm good ok talk to you later awkwardness kind of thing.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know.
TrainSen	00001	 scratch my neck.
TrainSen	00001	 anyways I never really knew about that but I've always liked him, 3ven after he insulted the cake at my 16th birthday party, I can't believe he didn't remember that at all and I thought it was so funny that he was just completely horrified at himself.
TrainSen	00001	 I love that story, it's almost as classic as the cookie analogy from homecoming my sophomore year when he and Chris both wanted to ask me, and then after that when bo liked me and I liked Chris and they were fighting over me.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if it was right that I brought it up that last night we were all together that was so much fun I can't believe I actually stayed there until 4 in the morning and I'm glad Chris never lit his cigar up around me that really would have made me mad even though I know bo really wanted him to, I'm glad bo didn't force the issue too much though because I would have felt bad but I didn't want him to do that around me I hate smoking so much I hope Andrew quits it'll kill him I think it's so funny that Leila figured out that he was the guy that was making out with marry at the Fiji island party, I'm glad I wasn't there because I think I would have been really embarrassed.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess that's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places.
TrainSen	00001	 it's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea what they're doing.
TrainSen	00001	 but I like not drinking, and I like feeling like I don't have to and people accept that.
TrainSen	00001	 it's really kind of nice wow I only have like 3 and a half minutes left that's pretty cool.
TrainSen	00001	 but I sure am getting there.
TrainSen	00001	 two dimes in the telephone alright, no it's not easy tonight.
TrainSen	00001	 good song I really do love this cd I wonder if Michelle is ever going to get me that nello cd, I really would love that.
TrainSen	00001	 or maybe if Chris could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it I loved that.
TrainSen	00001	 he first played that for me outside of casey's house.
TrainSen	00001	 what were we doing over there? were we going to a concert or something.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe? I don't remember.
TrainSen	00001	 ha-ha Hailey used to always say we went over there to see casey's brothers.
TrainSen	00001	 they're so hot.
TrainSen	00001	 but Kevin's married now.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't like how I just sounded like a bimbo there I really am smart I promise.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel really stupid in my world lit class though because I've never taken Latin and I haven't studied Greek, and I don't know I just feel like I'm behind the ball here on Dante's inferno.
TrainSen	00001	 I like the book a lot but I'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks.
TrainSen	00001	 starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far.
TrainSen	00001	 so don't make the wrong impression I don't want raffa to think I'm like stupid it's like in hagood's class though I guess I just have to learn when to speak up, it's like I'm wow that just interrupted me and I had no idea where I was going.
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I just get writing and I have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess that's what I have to do when I start writing a paper because instinctively I start editing myself before I even begin and then I just end up never really getting anywhere.
TrainSen	00001	 well I'm done here.
TrainSen	00001	 goodbye.
TrainSen	00001	Damn, I'm really hungry.
TrainSen	00001	 My girlfriend was really hungry too, so she came over to make some Spaghetti.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess it's already almost 6pm, so dinner wouldn't be a bad thing.
TrainSen	00001	 In fact, it would be a good thing.
TrainSen	00001	 It's pretty hot outside today.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a horrible crick in my neck.
TrainSen	00001	 Almost like I've been looking in the same direction for ages and never had my hinges oiled.
TrainSen	00001	 When I look to the left, it all seems to go away.
TrainSen	00001	 Perhaps I should start sitting on the other side of the classrooms.
TrainSen	00001	 I should start studying more often.
TrainSen	00001	 I passed my Computer Proficiency Test today.
TrainSen	00001	 not like I was terribly worried about it though.
TrainSen	00001	 I had my first quiz at UT today as well.
TrainSen	00001	 I ended up reading for my Financial Accounting class for an hour and a half at the AIM reading room at the school of business.
TrainSen	00001	 I did a few homework problems at the end, but didn't finish them.
TrainSen	00001	 If I would have been reading for my MIS class, I probably would have been prepared for the quiz.
TrainSen	00001	 It's pretty straightforward stuff though--especially with me being a certified Microsoft and Citrix network administrator.
TrainSen	00001	 My roommate Chad has been really sketchy lately.
TrainSen	00001	 I think it has to do with the fact that we moved in together as 'eligible bachelors' after both breaking up from serious relationships.
TrainSen	00001	 DAMN, those Italian herbs smell really good.
TrainSen	00001	 It's making my mouth start to water really bad.
TrainSen	00001	 I took a painting class last semester and did a few works -- one of them is sitting on my desk and keeps catching my attention.
TrainSen	00001	 I also have a double Dave's cup on my desk -- which is one of my favorite places to eat.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I'm going to turn some music on now [empty thoughts] I'm now listening to the sound of 311 (their self titled album to be more specific) I wonder if you all will actually read these.
TrainSen	00001	 My thought pattern seems to have become more spaced out since I've started listening to the music.
TrainSen	00001	 Oop--now it's picking up again.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a stack of CD's on top of my monitor.
TrainSen	00001	 Do you?  Do you have a stack of anything?  I once saw a stack of hay at my friends ranch.
TrainSen	00001	 The code to their ranch was 1991, because that's the year they purchased it.
TrainSen	00001	 The funny thing is, he now incorporated that number plus the first initial of him, his mom, his dad, and his two dogs into being his screen name.
TrainSen	00001	 This sucks that the time is going by so slowly.
TrainSen	00001	 At first it seemed to pass by really quickly--with the lines of text slowly appearing, but the time going by in increments of 30 seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 The spaghetti is ready.
TrainSen	00001	 Damnit, I'm hungry but I have to sit here for a little while more and type to no one.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder why brass was chosen as a doorknob color.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe because it looks similar to gold -- and gold is a precious commodity.
TrainSen	00001	 My stomach feels like it's burning right now.
TrainSen	00001	 Those aromas are filling my nose.
TrainSen	00001	 WOOOOO HOOOOO! My girlfriend, Laura, just brought me a plate full of Spaghetti and Meatballs.
TrainSen	00001	  to have a bite  As much as I really want to sit here and keep typing, I think I'm going to grab a drink to pair with my spaghetti.
TrainSen	00001	 Dr Pepper is pretty awesome.
TrainSen	00001	 I can type and watch TV at the same time.
TrainSen	00001	 I never thought being able to type without looking would be that good of a thing Now I get to use it while trying to complete my psychology assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 Yeeeaaaah! The assignment is over.
TrainSen	00001	this writing assignment is very interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 it is strange how it is somewhat difficult to simply write whatever I am thinking.
TrainSen	00001	 sometimes it is hard to tell.
TrainSen	00001	 I really need to catch up on some of my homework.
TrainSen	00001	 I also need to find a job.
TrainSen	00001	 high school was so much different than college is.
TrainSen	00001	 that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
TrainSen	00001	 just different.
TrainSen	00001	 I like living in Austin.
TrainSen	00001	 there is much more to do than there is in a town of under 300 people.
TrainSen	00001	 I am hungry.
TrainSen	00001	 where should I eat lunch today.
TrainSen	00001	 my parents are coming down this weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I'll leave.
TrainSen	00001	 to many people in a little apartment.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't really think I could handle it.
TrainSen	00001	 I got a cat.
TrainSen	00001	 well a kitten actually.
TrainSen	00001	 to keep my company.
TrainSen	00001	 it whines a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 and likes to crawl up my leg.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't really talked to that many people from back home since I have been here.
TrainSen	00001	 but that doesn't really bother me.
TrainSen	00001	 I need new people.
TrainSen	00001	 meeting people here is harder than I thought it would be.
TrainSen	00001	 I figured since this is a huge campus that it would be easy and just kind of happen.
TrainSen	00001	 but it turns out I think I might actually have to make an effort to meet new people.
TrainSen	00001	 I really need to find a job.
TrainSen	00001	 hopefully on-campus.
TrainSen	00001	 that would be great.
TrainSen	00001	 I am looking forward to psychology class today.
TrainSen	00001	 it is interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to learn how people think.
TrainSen	00001	 because I wish I knew a lot of the time.
TrainSen	00001	 but I don't really think that is something you can learn.
TrainSen	00001	 because everyone's mind works differently, so how can you learn how people think if it not the same with any one person?  how can you know the emotions and thoughts of the people around you?  I have a hard time knowing the thoughts and emotions of my closest friends.
TrainSen	00001	 and even myself at times.
TrainSen	00001	 the mind is so complex.
TrainSen	00001	 I have thought about majoring in psychology.
TrainSen	00001	 I just wish I had some clue as to what I want to do with my life.
TrainSen	00001	 it's like I am here, in college, finally, and I have no idea what to do with it.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I will figure it out.
TrainSen	00001	 I just get tired of waiting for that sudden thought to just pop into my head and me know that is what I want to do for the rest of my life.
TrainSen	00001	 that's a long time.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to do something I enjoy.
TrainSen	00001	 somewhere where I will be happy.
TrainSen	00001	 but I guess that is what everybody wants.
TrainSen	00001	 but why do some people find that, and not others.
TrainSen	00001	 what makes the lucky ones different.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess if everyone did what the wanted then there would be nobody to do the dirty work.
TrainSen	00001	 but it just seems unfair that some have it so could.
TrainSen	00001	 and some can never find that place where they feel content.
TrainSen	00001	 does that place really exist? I think so.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't think I have quite found it though.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I will though.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe I'll be one of those lucky ones.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss Jason.
TrainSen	00001	 is this going to work?  do I want it to?  I do but there are so many things to experience here.
TrainSen	00001	 will it change me? he thinks so.
TrainSen	00001	 but I don't know.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe it will.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe it should.
TrainSen	00001	 but where does that leave us? is there an us?  I have no idea how to handle that situation.
TrainSen	00001	 my parents are going crazy.
TrainSen	00001	 they miss me so much.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss them, but am relieved to not be in there household anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 I needed some freedom.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to learn to live on my own.
TrainSen	00001	 I really don't want a job though.
TrainSen	00001	 it will be hard to balance work and school and homework.
TrainSen	00001	 but I need to money.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I have to eat and pay rent.
TrainSen	00001	 I am really getting hungry.
TrainSen	00001	 I am not really that tired considering I got up at 7 this morning.
TrainSen	00001	 surprising.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't even taken a nap.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't think I will.
TrainSen	00001	 I rode the shuttle from my apartment this morning.
TrainSen	00001	 I usually drive.
TrainSen	00001	 but I can't afford to pay $7 everyday.
TrainSen	00001	 it wasn't that bad.
TrainSen	00001	 but I didn't really know where it was going to take me.
TrainSen	00001	 but I made it to class on time.
TrainSen	00001	 and didn't have to walk that far.
TrainSen	00001	 I just hope I am able to catch it this afternoon.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I know where it will pick me up.
TrainSen	00001	 but I don't know what time it runs really.
TrainSen	00001	 and how late it runs.
TrainSen	00001	 but I should be done here around 5.
TrainSen	00001	 cause I have a class from 3:30 till 5.
TrainSen	00001	 I really need to go to the gym.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I am going to talk some dance classes.
TrainSen	00001	 that sounds like fun.
TrainSen	00001	 and I bet it will help me meet more people.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to talk to Jason.
TrainSen	00001	 let him know I care and that I think about him a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 I know he worries.
TrainSen	00001	 I worry to.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to quit stressing about everything so much.
TrainSen	00001	 I worry myself to much.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess that is human nature though.
TrainSen	00001	 who knows what human nature really is.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe that is just an excuse for the way we act.
TrainSen	00001	 I know I use it as an excuse at times.
TrainSen	00001	 that's kind of sad.
TrainSen	00001	 but I guess everyone probably does.
TrainSen	00001	 wow my times almost up.
TrainSen	00001	 that didn't seem like 20 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 when you just start letting your thoughts go I guess time goes by pretty quickly.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I might take a nap.
TrainSen	00001	 but I have more homework that needs to be done.
TrainSen	00001	 dang there is so much reading.
TrainSen	00100	I am watching an episode of Mad TV and they were doing a parody on the whole parish priest / alterboy thing, singing Nelly's ""Hot in Herre"".
TrainSen	00100	 The whole thing makes me sick when I think about it.
TrainSen	00100	 My desktop died on me while I was up at UT and I am shopping for a new computer.
TrainSen	00100	 The soonest I could get one would probably be Christmas, because of the long delay in shipping and the safety issues of shipping it to home and having no one there to sign for it and shipping it to the dorm where someone might take it and I would never see it.
TrainSen	00100	 But it really sucks that my desktop would just crap out like it did.
TrainSen	00100	 At least I still have my laptop, even thought it is a brick, weighing over 10 pounds, but I chose it and paid for it.
TrainSen	00100	 All in all, life on the computer side just sucks.
TrainSen	00100	 I wrote this during Labor Day long weekend, so I just sitting here at home in Houston until tomorrow when I go back to Austin for a long haul, as I call it where I don't go back home until another holiday/long weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 But I don't mind, I really enjoy living in Austin, although the dorm I live in sucks due to construction noises.
TrainSen	00100	 I have late classes on TTH and I don't get up until like 11, but I still am awakened by construction at 10 or so.
TrainSen	00100	 Even though I didn't know my roommate until I move in with him, I do not regret going potluck.
TrainSen	00100	 He is pretty cool, and he respects my wishes and I do the same for him.
TrainSen	00100	 He has early classes on the same days that I do, so he doesn't bother me when he gets up in the morning, and I don't bother him when I wake up, because he has the same classes at the same times as I do.
TrainSen	00100	 So that is cool.
TrainSen	00100	 It's an oddity that I am writing this, for I do not really know how to write papers.
TrainSen	00100	 So I decided to write this like I would for my blog on LiveJournal, like I am writing to my best friends.
TrainSen	00100	 When I get back to Austin, I need to get my Calculus book and maybe find a movie that me and my friends can go to, just as kind of a day off thing to kill time before the daily grind starts again.
TrainSen	00100	 Sadly II feel like this after only one and a half weeks of school at UT, into my freshman year.
TrainSen	00100	 But the work is not the problem, the problem is the walking, but I will have to just get used to that aspect of UT.
TrainSen	01000	Ok, well here we are.
TrainSen	01000	 Typing away at our writing assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 YAY! I hope I'm doing this right.
TrainSen	01000	 The TV.
TrainSen	01000	 is really distracting me right now.
TrainSen	01000	 Not so much that I can't type, but I keep thinking about Abe Lincoln.
TrainSen	01000	 I love that guy.
TrainSen	01000	 He's tall.
TrainSen	01000	 Tall I sure as hell am not tall.
TrainSen	01000	 That's a shame too, I could have a good tall guy.
TrainSen	01000	 GEEZE, it's only been two minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 This sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 Now, now, give it a chance.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate you.
TrainSen	01000	 Shut up.
TrainSen	01000	 Ok so lets see here.
TrainSen	01000	 I like apple sauce.
TrainSen	01000	 Definitely going to have me some apple sauce as soon as am done with this assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 I have a giant jar of apple sauce sitting in my frig.
TrainSen	01000	 Hate people.
TrainSen	01000	 They're so stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate the way they act and treat others.
TrainSen	01000	 Ah.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm rambling, stop it.
TrainSen	01000	 Ok lets see, I like toys.
TrainSen	01000	 Toys are fun.
TrainSen	01000	 I remember the good old days when Christmas was all about the toys.
TrainSen	01000	 Now Christmas sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate Christmas so much.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate the way we have to spend time with the family, I hate all the cheery people, and I hate how everyone is happier than me.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean if people would just concentrate on .
TrainSen	01000	 I hate my roommate.
TrainSen	01000	 Always drinking my water.
TrainSen	01000	 Why must he touch my stuff without asking.
TrainSen	01000	 Sorry he just walked in and I remembered that he took my water bottle.
TrainSen	01000	 Crap, where was I, Christmas blows! It's just I think people have forgot the real me, I just saw some breast on the TV.
TrainSen	01000	 and now I've lost tract of what I was saying.
TrainSen	01000	 Ah yes, Christmas angers me.
TrainSen	01000	 It's just that people, I think, celebrate jolly old saint Nicholas and the bright lights and trees, more than the birth of Jesus.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm sorry know I'm watching ROCKY IV on TV.
TrainSen	01000	 I love rocky, he's amazing.
TrainSen	01000	 I even named my dog Rocky in honor of Sly.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow not even ten minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 Well I'm just saying I'd be happier with Christmas if people just went to church all day on Christmas than celebrate Santa Crap.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh no, I'm talking to myself again, blast I hate when I do that.
TrainSen	01000	 DING DING, sorry, it's a line in Rocky IV.
TrainSen	01000	 Favorite line in ROCKY IV, ""Age before beauty,"" as Apollo Creed lets Rocky, fucking roommate took my boxers.
TrainSen	01000	 Sorry I just pressed enter as if I was sending a message on instant messi, how do you spell messenger, oh there we go.
TrainSen	01000	 It's just he was shopping for boxers, and I found a pair that I liked and then.
TrainSen	01000	 we weren't shopping alone, we had to girls with us, (just for the record.
TrainSen	01000	 ) anyways, what, ah I liked a pair and.
TrainSen	01000	 wait, I think I'm screwing up the assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 QUICK ding dong the witch is dead, the witch is dead.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm tired and I'm really really dumb.
TrainSen	01000	 Hi my name is the undead and I like sleeping.
TrainSen	01000	 ok lost train of thought there.
TrainSen	01000	 hmmmmmmm, pizza rolls.
TrainSen	01000	 I smell pizza rolls because my roommate just made some, probably mine that he stole, fucking ass.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to be an actor.
TrainSen	01000	 I love that they made five Rockys, I wish I had an accent, like a scottish or german one.
TrainSen	01000	 The word Finish looks German.
TrainSen	01000	 I tried learning German, FOR THAT FUCKING WHORE!!!!!!! I hate everything.
TrainSen	01000	 Especially her.
TrainSen	01000	 Not really, I actually love her(possibly), I just grrr.
TrainSen	01000	 , hate that time of my life.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I was six feet tall, that would be badass.
TrainSen	01000	 Hot, now there's a funny word, sorry I just heard the word hot on TV.
TrainSen	01000	 Now Lacrosse, there's a fun sport.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I get to play sometime , fucking roommate always distracting me.
TrainSen	01000	 NO NO, he cool, it's just I.
TrainSen	01000	 Get back on tract.
TrainSen	01000	 School is very educational to me.
TrainSen	01000	 I like it.
TrainSen	01000	 Now drugs are bad, very very bad.
TrainSen	01000	 I got to start eating better, much better.
TrainSen	01000	 YAHOOO, almost done.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not even sure what I've written about, but you know what, it doesn't matter, because I own shit and I run shit.
TrainSen	00001	Hello, my name is Jason.
TrainSen	00001	 I felt like I needed to introduce myself since someone will be reading this assignment, and I am not familiar with that person.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyhow, lets talk about some stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 Hmm, where should I begin? I was born in Alice.
TrainSen	00001	 If your thinking this is like a biography, then I think that you will be wrong.
TrainSen	00001	 However, back to what I was saying.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't really like traveling to Alice, TX.
TrainSen	00001	 I find it kind of boring because I don't have anyone over there that is my age.
TrainSen	00001	 All of my relatives are much older than I.
TrainSen	00001	 These people don't tend to interest me because they are always bogged down with the problems that they create.
TrainSen	00001	 Lets talk about my uncle for instance.
TrainSen	00001	 I will not mention his name, however, he was.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean is a drug addict and is constantly in and out of jail.
TrainSen	00001	 Why would I be interested in going and visiting him unless I wanted some crack or something? He is a liar anyways, and I don't like affiliating myself with those kinds of people.
TrainSen	00001	 Speaking of the kind of people I affiliate (if that's even how u spell the word) myself with, I think that I accidentally roomed with a gay person this semester.
TrainSen	00001	 Had to look over my shoulder to make sure he's not behind me or something.
TrainSen	00001	 However, he makes a lot of homosexual remarks, and although he says he is just playing, I think he does it all too frequently to be playing around.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways, I'm sick of talking about him because that guy is more and more annoying everyday.
TrainSen	00001	 Lets talk about my big brother.
TrainSen	00001	 Now this guy is someone who has his crap cut out.
TrainSen	00001	 This is the reason that I look up to him.
TrainSen	00001	 He knows how to manage his time, talk to his gf on the telephone for hours at a time, go out on the weekends, and still get all A's! I have to admit that I am somewhat jealous.
TrainSen	00001	 However, he does help me out and gives really great advice.
TrainSen	00001	 When he tutors me, I feel like he teaches better than a lot of professors.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe this is because he has known me for so long and knows how I retain material.
TrainSen	00001	 He is two years older than me, but I am tired of talking about him because he always hogs the damn spotlight.
TrainSen	00001	 Lets talk about my boxing, because that always gets me the respect and acknowledgement that I feel is so precious to a person.
TrainSen	00001	 I hated not being respected.
TrainSen	00001	 It made me sick to my stomach when someone would cut me in line or throw a pencil or whatnot at me and I couldn't do anything about it because that person had a physical strength advantage over me.
TrainSen	00001	 However, I put an end to all that crap when I joined the boxing team in the summer of my freshman year in high school.
TrainSen	00001	 I learned how to fight the hard way though.
TrainSen	00001	 My coach sucked and didn't teach me a thing, so I just kept fighting and watching fights and picked up on different styles and tricks of the trade.
TrainSen	00001	 I adopted a slugger's style of fighting.
TrainSen	00001	 The reason is because my foot movement was never all that great.
TrainSen	00001	 My strength began to get developed when I began lifting weights in my freshman year, and it suited my fighting style great.
TrainSen	00001	 That year, a couple of kids decided to mess with me, so I took them to the mat room (part of the gym in my high school), and floored them one by one.
TrainSen	00001	 Man it was great, the respect that those fights generated was awesome.
TrainSen	00001	 From then on out, word of mouth about those fights got me my respect.
TrainSen	00001	 I didn't even have to fight anymore! But I kept on because I got too competitive and I kind of liked it.
TrainSen	00001	 Currently, I'm undefeated in my hometown.
TrainSen	00001	 However, I was just an average fighter when it came to the Golden Gloves.
TrainSen	00001	 I stopped when I started college.
TrainSen	00001	 That's enough of that.
TrainSen	00001	 My father is the next person I want to discuss.
TrainSen	00001	 He has worked his way from rock bottom, and I admire that.
TrainSen	00001	 He slept in a car for 6 months and bathed in a nearby river when he was working in maintenance away (for a railroad company called Southern Pacific).
TrainSen	00001	 He helps us out so much and he's funding my tuition for college all by himself (cause my mom divorced him a couple of years ago).
TrainSen	00001	 I still love her and all, I just don't agree with anything she does.
TrainSen	00001	 She seems to have tunnel vision, u know what I mean? Let me explain because my time here is almost up.
TrainSen	00001	 She is one of those people who will see something she wants, and direct all of her attention to acquiring that one thing, no matter who she hurts.
TrainSen	00001	 Today she seems more like a stranger, cause I don't see her all that much.
TrainSen	00001	 She didn't invite me to her wedding.
TrainSen	00001	 My time is up.
TrainSen	00001	 Talk to u later.
TrainSen	00001	I just failed my chemistry quiz.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel .
TrainSen	00001	 depressed?  I could have gotten the correct answer it was just that I was answering the question incorrectly.
TrainSen	00001	 At first I thought it was the TA's fault, maybe she done the test wrong.
TrainSen	00001	 But as I was turning in the quiz I finally realized that I had been solving for the wrong question.
TrainSen	00001	 Hey there's a squirrel with a piece of pizza that is bigger than him !! Ha-ha, cute.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways, I was turning in the quiz when I realized this.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well it was too late anyways.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if that's how it feels when you die and go to heaven and actually realize you were praying for the wrong person or to no one at all.
TrainSen	00001	 Just a waste of time.
TrainSen	00001	 There's a lot of people around here, thank you the group of people that came up with wireless internet.
TrainSen	00001	 There's really nothing much going around in my mind right now, except for the whole feeling guilty/depressed for failing that chem quiz.
TrainSen	00001	 I went to the HPO to pick up the application for the JAMP program they want at least a 3.
TrainSen	00001	 25 gpa and 3.
TrainSen	00001	 0 gpa in the science areas in order to be admitted into it.
TrainSen	00001	 I already failed my chem quiz , what to do.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a test next week in chemistry, hopefully I will learn from my previous mistakes in my quiz and I will get an A .
TrainSen	00001	 Hhahaha, squirrels they are so funny and cute, they are everywhere around this campus, that's what I love about it here, the whole not so dirty as Houston thing going on .
TrainSen	00001	 Its so clean , well around here it is still haven't seen the rest of Austin.
TrainSen	00001	 I bet squirrels back at home wouldn't even come up this close as the ones in here do,  What is love.
TrainSen	00001	 I have been thinking about that , I want to believe my practical side and think that it is nothing but a bunch of hormones hitting your pleasure area in the brain.
TrainSen	00001	 Or that love is just conformity, you find someone stay with them because you never want to be alone again.
TrainSen	00001	 Or is love really something else, do we stay alive for it?  Is it really forever even after you die?  Maybe that's just something we want to believe in because we are also afraid of being alone even after we die.
TrainSen	00001	 Do we really need love to be happy?  I mean love as in an ""only one"" your significant other, do we really need that kind of love to be happy in life , or is it really just another experience we go through?  What is love to women?  Are they just trying to find another paternal figure in their life in order to replace the one they had when they were young?  I mean think about it, if a girl had a bad experience with her dad, she'd view all men the same.
TrainSen	00001	 So lets say she lost her respect for him, we'll she then lose respect for all men? Will she be able to be in a healthy relationship?  All these questions, and I can't type fast.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm a slow typer.
TrainSen	00001	 But yeah, why are we here anyways.
TrainSen	00001	 Is life nothing but insignificant events that happen in no random order and were really just nothing at all.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean I'm sure if all of humanity died, the earth would still spin, maybe the earth will be better with out all of us.
TrainSen	00001	 Sometimes we think we are the center of the universe.
TrainSen	00001	 But really we are nothing at all, just a speck in the abyss of the dark universe.
TrainSen	00001	 Ew, there was some stuff on my hands where did it come from.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe a bird pooped on me, you can't trust those birds.
TrainSen	00001	 I rubbed it all over my forehead, maybe I should check what it is, wait I have to finish this thing.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm thinking about majoring in some other field now, like psychology, but I love my current HAHAHAHA there is a squirrel in the trash can !! HOW CUTE.
TrainSen	00001	 So psychology sounds interesting buy I also looooooooove biology.
TrainSen	10000	Right now I'm feeling overwhelmed at all the work that has been given to me.
TrainSen	10000	 There is so much reading that I have to get done and so little time with all the classes I am taking.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I am thinking of a way to manage my time and get everything done.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I am hearing dead silence as my roommates and I are all studying in the same room.
TrainSen	10000	 I am also hearing the fan and the doors slam from others people who are down the hall from me.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I am feeling very tired and my eyes are about to shut but I'm trying my best to stay awake.
TrainSen	10000	 As I type, I'm thinking about other work that needs to be done by tomorrow and wondering if I'm ever going to get that done tonight.
TrainSen	10000	 At this instant I'm noticing how  there are so many pictures of friends in front of me and how much I miss them.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm wondering about how tomorrow's classes are going to be and what other will be assigned for that day.
TrainSen	10000	 I am also thinking about how hard my classes are and how I am going to pass them.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm trying to figure out a way to manage my time, a way to prevent me from procrastinate, and a way to stay in control with my study habits.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I also feel sad because I really miss my family.
TrainSen	10000	 It's so hard for me to be away from them because I'm so close to them.
TrainSen	10000	 I especially miss my little bother and little sister.
TrainSen	10000	 They always make me laugh.
TrainSen	10000	 Today my day was tough.
TrainSen	10000	 I hardly understood what was going on in there so I had to stay after class and ask questions.
TrainSen	10000	 As for my critical thinking seminar, I had a hard time participating mainly because of what the topic was about.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I'm hearing no noise at all and it's just making me tired.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel very cold right now because the fan is right in front of me and it's making my eyes dry.
TrainSen	00100	ok, so I guess I just type here.
TrainSen	00100	 for twenty minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 Hrm interesting you know I think this will get very boring really fast.
TrainSen	00100	 (and my roommate asks ""so you just write? anything? crazy dude"") wow.
TrainSen	00100	 I thought at least something would come but er.
TrainSen	00100	 Never mind.
TrainSen	00100	 I do not know really what to write about.
TrainSen	00100	 great and only a minute and a half into it.
TrainSen	00100	 er.
TrainSen	00100	 hrm, maybe write about this computer, or the fact that I do not have one yet.
TrainSen	00100	 that sucks.
TrainSen	00100	 in college and I have to either go to a lab or use someone else's computer while constantly I see others around on their own machines.
TrainSen	00100	 I have a phone call! yay.
TrainSen	00100	 my 'mentor' telling me about an event in front of ECJ.
TrainSen	00100	 weird trying to type and talk at the same time about two completely off different things.
TrainSen	00100	 eh.
TrainSen	00100	 phone's off.
TrainSen	00100	 coming on five minutes now.
TrainSen	00100	 almost.
TrainSen	00100	 So I was early.
TrainSen	00100	 you know this can't all be that interesting typing for a solid twenty minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 most of these papers must be extremely boring.
TrainSen	00100	 unless someone goes off and just starts telling a story or something.
TrainSen	00100	 hrm, sounds like maybe something to do.
TrainSen	00100	 well, it all began a long time ago.
TrainSen	00100	 well, long in the sense that they were young when it began; that time period to others may just be what they consider a few years or so.
TrainSen	00100	 (did you know that is you try to hit tab to indent it takes you out of the typing window.
TrainSen	00100	 very annoying I must say) (I need a name.
TrainSen	00100	 Er, Samsung monitor, ok the character's name is Sam) Sam had been a small child when his father disappeared, therefore he had little memory of him.
TrainSen	00100	 all he could think of was being told stories as he was falling asleep or going to the occasional trip to the park.
TrainSen	00100	 nothing really stood out to tell him what his father was like.
TrainSen	00100	 many others that had known his father would tell him that he was an odd person, constantly coming up with random ideas or running off to work on something new and exciting, except that no one ever knew exactly what he ran off to do.
TrainSen	00100	 they also told him of when his father was younger; he would disappear for days on end, supposedly off camping or exploring by himself, and would return different.
TrainSen	00100	 how different, they could not quite say, but something changed in him.
TrainSen	00100	 , not always for the better.
TrainSen	00100	 often he would come back slightly depressed or would remain to himself for weeks, but after time, he would return to his energetic self.
TrainSen	00100	 (I notice I seem to misspell quite a bit and even though I try to catch and fix the word as I type it, some words do get through without my notice and I'd rather not go back and change them.
TrainSen	00100	 Also I tend not to capitalize much when typing.
TrainSen	00100	 this is probably due to the fact that I have grown to accustomed to writing in Word and it will capitalize certain things automatically; that and I am usually too lazy to remember to do so.
TrainSen	00100	 ) After Sam's father disappeared the last time, his mother fell into a strange illness.
TrainSen	00100	 there was not a doctor who they could find who could explain the sickness.
TrainSen	00100	 it was as if something from another world.
TrainSen	10000	well I guess I am just supposed to start writing.
TrainSen	10000	 Well I will start by telling this computer about my day.
TrainSen	10000	 Today I went to class, well first I was supposed to wake up at 5:45 am but instead I pushed my snooze button one too many times and ended up sleeping until 6:45,my bus leaves at 7:00.
TrainSen	10000	 So I missed my bus, the third time this school year, I just can't seem to get it together.
TrainSen	10000	 But anyways I arrived to my class 25 minutes late, and since it was my third time late to this class it was slightly embarrassing, especially since the only two doors into the classroom are right where the teacher is teaching.
TrainSen	10000	 So I slowly made my entrance and went and sat in the back of the class, and for once I didn't fall asleep! AMAZING! I then decided to do my chemistry homework that I thought was due today but its really not due till Thursday.
TrainSen	10000	 So I wasted my time off doing homework that wasn't even due, not like I understood much of it anyways.
TrainSen	10000	 Well so then I was out of school for the day! My boyfriend, John, doesn't get out of class until 1:15 and it was only 12:30 so I decided to go to Barnes and Nobles and finish reading an interesting book I had started a week ago.
TrainSen	10000	 Its called ""A Boy Called It"" its actually a very upsetting book because its about this boy who endured horrible child abuse for the better part of his childhood.
TrainSen	10000	 His mother was basically insane.
TrainSen	10000	 She played horrible games with him, like making him burn his own arm over the stove, making him eat his brother's dirty diaper, and starving him to death, not to mention beating him to a pulp everyday.
TrainSen	10000	 And his family just stood by and watched him take it.
TrainSen	10000	 What kind of father could watch his son be abused like that and not do anything? That just makes me sick.
TrainSen	10000	 Well so anyways I almost finished the book when John called and picked me up so we could hang out.
TrainSen	10000	 So we watched Hannibal.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh what a creepy movie! The grossest part was when he took the scalp off one cop and scooped out some of his brain while he was still alive.
TrainSen	10000	 AND THEN, fed it to him! It was pretty disgusting.
TrainSen	10000	 So after that we just kind of hung around his house doing nothing, but I love the fact that I can just do nothing with him and not be bored.
TrainSen	10000	 But oh the drama that our relationship has caused with our friends! I don't even want to get into it.
TrainSen	10000	 HMMM I'm thinking about going downstairs and getting myself another cookie, I'm addicted! I'm a chocoholic! But seriously I need to start working out, or eating less or something because I'm feeling a little on the chunky side.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe tomorrow I will do that.
TrainSen	10000	 Yea right, like I have the time.
TrainSen	10000	 I'll just starve myself, naw those cookies are just too darn good! I'm so happy that this medication I'm taking is finally feeling like its working! I'm so tired of feeling sad and depressed all the time, and a couple nights ago I just took it way too far.
TrainSen	10000	 The thought of cutting myself again just makes me sick now.
TrainSen	10000	 So I'm getting better! I think its funny that Professor Pennebaker told us not to make this a cry for help, because a few weeks ago it might have been and I would have been one of the lost causes.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, that cookie really sounds good.
TrainSen	10000	 This music also sounds good, I like music a lot, it just seems like a great way to express yourself! Even though I don't play anything, and I can't sing worth crap I like to listen to music as a release.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I'm very into alternative rock and new age rock.
TrainSen	10000	 Last night I downloaded 6 hours worth of music onto this computer so now I'm set for life! Nirvana is a cool band, too bad Kurt Cobain killed himself he was a great musician! He killed himself on my birthday, how weird is that? Speaking of birthdays I need to get my mom a birthday present! Maybe I will have time on Thursday before Defensive driving class! I sure hope so.
TrainSen	00010	It smells really good in my apartment.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate's girlfriend is making chicken and I'm cooking out.
TrainSen	00010	 I love Monday night football.
TrainSen	00010	 Its on tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 it is Thursday night but this is the opening game but abc is covering the game.
TrainSen	00010	 watching football is putting me in a good mood.
TrainSen	00010	 I am in the process of cooking out on the grill.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm really tired right now but I have a test tomorrow.
TrainSen	00010	 last night I had like three hockey games.
TrainSen	00010	 on real game and then the school team, we had practice.
TrainSen	00010	 we got a new dog and it sometimes keeps me up at night.
TrainSen	00010	 he is a jack russel terrier and his name is miller.
TrainSen	00010	 the washing machine is going and it is really loud.
TrainSen	00010	 just like the dishwasher.
TrainSen	00010	 the patriots are winning now they just kicked a field goal.
TrainSen	00010	 my girlfriend is doing her homework over in the dining room.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what she is working on.
TrainSen	00010	 the dishwasher stopped and now it is quiet in here.
TrainSen	00010	 john madden annoys me.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not really watching the game because I'm doing this but I hear him commenting on the game.
TrainSen	00010	 all he does is state the obvious.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't need to hear him tell me what I just saw.
TrainSen	00010	 I can believe he gets paid.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope I get a good job like that were I get paid very well and the job can be fun.
TrainSen	00010	 it just got really hot in my apartment really fast.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to turn down the thermostat.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't want to study tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 I just want to chill.
TrainSen	00010	 I am worrying occasionally because I changed my major and I am now trying to get into upper division.
TrainSen	00010	 my new major is sport management.
TrainSen	00010	 it used to be economics.
TrainSen	00010	 a beer would great right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I just saw a Coors light commercial.
TrainSen	00010	 that's good advertising.
TrainSen	00010	 well I'm halfway done with this thing.
TrainSen	00010	 there is not much to say I just keep thinking of the same things.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope Texas football wins this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 Arkansas beat us last year but I think we will beat them this year.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to go put the meat on the grill because I am hungry.
TrainSen	00010	 I have to do this for 7 more minutes then I can do that.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm cooking this really good sausage that my girlfriend bought in Elgin, Texas.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm so hungry.
TrainSen	00010	 its making it worse because of my roommates food that they are making is smelling really good.
TrainSen	00010	 hopefully the patriots will win this game.
TrainSen	00010	 they are winning this game.
TrainSen	00010	 they won last year in the conference championship.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm ready for the hockey season to start.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I could go play hockey tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what my dog is doing.
TrainSen	00010	 my roommate is yelling at him so I'm sure he is doing something mischievous because he is always doing stuff like that.
TrainSen	00010	 be quiet john madden.
TrainSen	00010	 this is a long twenty minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm still hungry.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm ready for the weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 it will be fun.
TrainSen	00010	 dang the patriots are punting.
TrainSen	00010	 I need a new car.
TrainSen	00010	 mine is a 2 door Tahoe that is a 93 so it is eleven year old.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't wait till next Wednesday for the incubus concert.
TrainSen	00010	 they are my favorite band and they are coming to Austin to play.
TrainSen	00010	 it will be sweet.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm going with all my friends.
TrainSen	00001	there is so much going on my room right now, some it probably isn't the best time to be writing right now well I guess it'll give them more to think about.
TrainSen	00001	 There is this song on rt now I think its called legionaries its cool it makes me think of like knights and stuff, its kinds up-beat and fun my roommate is talking to her dad about her palm pilot.
TrainSen	00001	 I love the way he said boulevard its like the greatest British accent.
TrainSen	00001	 I've been to Britain well I mean England.
TrainSen	00001	 Either way I want to have a friend who is British like a guy friend I guess because I don't think id want to date a British guy, they all have gross teeth, I don't really understand that like do they not go to the dentist or know what a toothbrush is or something.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh I don't think I've ever seen a British person with braces either I guess it has to be something to do with the dentist.
TrainSen	00001	 I just changed the song on my cd player, the song was called Clementine which reminds me of my favorite movie, well one of my favorite movies, I have like a ton of favorite things, they are never ending.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm always like yeah this is my fav song or this is my fav band, and the person I am talking to will be like wait I  thought you said that blah blah was your fav band, and then I'm like well yeah them too.
TrainSen	00001	 Well anyway one of my fav movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, its so weird but you know those are fav type of movies, I don't think I have a fav that everyone else like and I don't so it on purpose to be diff or anything oh and by the way I absolutely can't stand those type of people who feel that they have to be diff so they do stuff so blatantly different just so that they will be the center of attention, drives me nuts, like people who dye their hair like crazy colors or people who wear weird like way out there kind of clothes, and I bet is you were to ask them why their hair looks like that or why they're wearing that they'll just tell you.
TrainSen	00001	 I've lost my train of thought, what I was going to say wasn't really going to make any sense.
TrainSen	00001	 My roommate uses her palm pilot for everything, I don't know if I could deal using one of those for everything, I couldn't live without my comp, but my cell phone has a lot of the options that palm pilots do like a calendar and alarms a phone book so whatever.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I should get my blood sugar measured, because I think since I have been at college all I do now is eat, and not healthy foods, I have to have something sweet all the time, it is kind of showing on my figure.
TrainSen	00001	 I was just thinking about how I looked in a leotard today in my ballet class, I'm not as comfortable being in one as I used to be.
TrainSen	00001	Ok.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm here in the CPE building during mandatory study time.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm trying to catch up on some missed work, like this stream of consciousness writing exercise which I couldn't do before hand because I lost my class code number.
TrainSen	00001	   Well.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyway, let's see what's on my mind.
TrainSen	00001	 The Mets are really bad.
TrainSen	00001	 I've actually begun rooting against them so they'll fall into last place and Art Howe will be fired.
TrainSen	00001	 He really is an Awful manager.
TrainSen	00001	 Personally, I liked Bobby Valentine.
TrainSen	00001	 Sure he had a couple rough moments, but overall he was a much more effective manager.
TrainSen	00001	 Hmmm.
TrainSen	00001	 well.
TrainSen	00001	 my friend Scott Neff, who used to work for the mets, sat down with Jim Duquette the other day and JD pretty much vented all of his anger about this season and his distaste for Art Howe.
TrainSen	00001	 They've begun to give him nicknames in the clubhouse.
TrainSen	00001	 For example: The Wizard, The Wiz, and The Grandfather.
TrainSen	00001	 There was a little bit of a pause there because I took a swig of water.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm pretty sure the guy behind me is looking at what I'm writing.
TrainSen	00001	 Is that a little bit disconcerting.
TrainSen	00001	 Yes.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm glad I will be taking advantage of this time.
TrainSen	00001	 3 hrs of studying a night can really keep you on track.
TrainSen	00001	 I just turned my cell phone off.
TrainSen	00001	 James has handwriting that's hard to understand.
TrainSen	00001	 My battery life remains surprisingly high.
TrainSen	00001	 Wireless internet is pretty awesome.
TrainSen	00001	 Wow.
TrainSen	00001	 This is the first time I've used wireless internet.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder how long I've been typing? Probably 8 or 9 minutes which means that I should probably stop around 8:56.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what I'm going to have to do after 11 pm.
TrainSen	00001	 I should have brought those quarters.
TrainSen	00001	 I knew I should have.
TrainSen	00001	 But then I would have been late.
TrainSen	00001	 I've got this compulsion for grammatical correctness.
TrainSen	00001	 Is that weird? Well, I talked to my mom today.
TrainSen	00001	 She and my dad took the top down in the convertible for the first time today.
TrainSen	00001	 That's sick.
TrainSen	00001	 My dads had that car since before I left for school.
TrainSen	00001	 That's over a month now and he hasn't even taken the roof down!!! He spent 70 grand almost on a convertible and doesn't even bother to take the roof down! tell me that's not a disgusting waste.
TrainSen	00001	 Someone came in and asked for the sign in sheet.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder how the ghs theater stuff is going.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought Id miss it a little bit.
TrainSen	00001	 And I kind of do.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss the actual acting aspect of it.
TrainSen	00001	 But you can't imagine the relief of not having to deal with kohn at all.
TrainSen	00001	 It should be pretty cool to come back home though and visit.
TrainSen	00001	 It must be all the more liberating to view that whole situation from the outside.
TrainSen	00001	 Or maybe it will just bring back weird memories.
TrainSen	00001	 My finger.
TrainSen	00001	 No my thumb really itches.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm thinking I should wash my hands.
TrainSen	00001	 They feel pretty grimy.
TrainSen	00001	 I did wash them after I ate that sushi though.
TrainSen	00001	 The sushi was surprisingly good.
TrainSen	00001	 On the other hand it should be good if its $8.
TrainSen	00001	 The smell in the room.
TrainSen	00001	 Well there is no distinguishable smell.
TrainSen	00001	 Back in jester though.
TrainSen	00001	 WOW.
TrainSen	00001	 That place smells incredibly bad.
TrainSen	00001	 It's always a mixture of body odor, popcorn and some sort of Lysol.
TrainSen	00001	 Really nasty.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder how Lauren is doing? I really like that girl, but lately my attraction to her is more as a friend.
TrainSen	00001	 Sexually, she is pretty frustrating.
TrainSen	00001	 I assume all Mormons are.
TrainSen	00001	 But when I have numerous girls around me who are much more.
TrainSen	00001	 um.
TrainSen	00001	 Liberal sexually, it makes me think twice more often than I'd like.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what she thinks of me.
TrainSen	00001	 That situation with Tyler is fu.
TrainSen	00001	 Messed up.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm sure she knows that.
TrainSen	00001	 But now that I think of it.
TrainSen	00001	 That whole thing is pretty messed up.
TrainSen	00001	 OH well.
TrainSen	00001	 Someone came in the room and kindly asked us to be quiet.
TrainSen	00001	 He's walking over to someone.
TrainSen	00001	 Whispering in his ear.
TrainSen	00001	 Smiling.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 I think my battery life is running low.
TrainSen	00001	 I think my 20 mins is up.
TrainSen	00010	I just finished taking the prescreening survey and I could not help but feel that some of those questions were ridiculous and repetitive.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not even sure that I will agree to participate in any extra surveys even if I'm qualified.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't feel comfortable being subject to any questionable tests - the guinea pig feeling makes me feel lesser, I guess.
TrainSen	00010	 I have a lot on my mind concerning a specific event that happened yesterday, and I surprisingly feel comfortable talking about it.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel alright talking to people, but somehow it's different typing my feelings onto a screen.
TrainSen	00010	 this screen represents nothing to me right now, I don't know if anyone will ever read or really care about reading this.
TrainSen	00010	 somehow I'm still making sure that I am spelling words correctly and using acceptable grammar.
TrainSen	00010	 anyway, the event that I found out about yesterday.
TrainSen	00010	 involves losing a person that I knew in high school.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't stop thinking about the fact that just two years ago we were sitting in the same classrooms and wandering the same halls, and now one of us isn't here.
TrainSen	00010	 it's very clear in my mind that we weren't the best of friends, but we shared the same circle of friends and some of my best friends knew her very well.
TrainSen	00010	 I personally haven't spoken or seen her since graduation, but I knew she would accomplish everything she wanted and do it better than anyone else.
TrainSen	00010	 now that I think about it (and I can't stop thinking about it) she is one of the most brilliant people I have met in my life.
TrainSen	00010	 she graduated 5th in our class, and spent this past summer at Princeton for a research project; definitely someone who was going somewhere.
TrainSen	00010	 I never thought that something like this could happen to one of ""us,"" the people that basically built the foundation for the person that I am today.
TrainSen	00010	 I know we weren't the closest that friends could be, but my best friends are wrecks right now, and that affects me.
TrainSen	00010	 it's a direct and indirect effect, not so much one thing with a yield arrow leading to another thing, but more like a huge web of thoughts that are clinging to me.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm tangled and I'm not sure where this leaves me.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate that I can't remember the last thing that we said to each other.
TrainSen	00010	 nevertheless I was perfectly fine knowing that she was off in her world, and I was off in mine, both separately pursuing the things that we love most in the world.
TrainSen	00010	 it's not fair that her life wasn't complete enough for her to fulfill everything she wanted to do.
TrainSen	00010	 it's not fair that they found her the way that they did; it's not fair that we don't know and we won't know for a long time.
TrainSen	00010	 the truth of what happened.
TrainSen	00010	 everything is so complex.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't call anyone; I mean, I can call, but I don't know what I could say that would offer any comfort.
TrainSen	00010	 it'd be different if I were there with our friends, must to hold a hand or sit next to someone who understands.
TrainSen	00010	 nobody here at UT went to my high school, and I doubt that anyone on campus can come close to saying that something like this happened to somebody he or she knew.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel alone, I feel helpless, but at the same time I feel like I'm connected to everyone else who knew her because, well, we're all probably feeling alone right now.
TrainSen	00010	 college is supposed to help us branch out and find ourselves, become good individuals in this world.
TrainSen	00010	 at the same time, in the time between our high school graduation and now, we've all become isolated from each other.
TrainSen	00010	 it sucks that it takes something like this for me to finally feel like we belong together and that the time that we spent together was precious.
TrainSen	00010	 all time in the world is precious now.
TrainSen	00010	 things that I was worried about before I heard the news, any stress that I felt weighing on me in the past week has disappeared.
TrainSen	00010	 homework and little things seem trivial to me.
TrainSen	00010	 in a way things seem simplified now: we either are.
TrainSen	00010	 or we aren't.
TrainSen	00010	 just being here doesn't seem right- but is it selfish to be so so glad that I am here?  I wonder if I deserve it, or if I can earn my place here.
TrainSen	00010	 then again, who knows if it's so bad on the other side.
TrainSen	00010	 I see that I have less than three minutes left to stream my consciousness.
TrainSen	00010	 what a perfect day for me to tell my feelings to nobody in particular, and for them to disappear into a screen as soon as I press ""finish,"" yet for them to linger in my mind still.
TrainSen	00010	 any other day I would have felt that this assignment was worthless, but I'll admit it.
TrainSen	00010	 feeling like a part of myself is being put out there-a huge or small risk, I'm not sure-makes me feel the slightest bit better.
TrainSen	00001	Well, I'm really not thinking about anything in particular except for the fact that I know I have to do this.
TrainSen	00001	 Just got back from school and had lunch.
TrainSen	00001	 My whole apartment smells of black pepper chicken; spicy stuff, but yummy.
TrainSen	00001	 I cooked it last night, ah.
TrainSen	00001	 the life of a college student.
TrainSen	00001	 I've left the TV on.
TrainSen	00001	 I always like to watch something as I eat.
TrainSen	00001	 Something to entertain, or dull and numb the mind.
TrainSen	00001	 It's been a good week, but everything has passed so fast.
TrainSen	00001	 I've always wondered about the concept of time.
TrainSen	00001	 How it can feel so simultaneously fast and slow at the same time.
TrainSen	00001	 I have the worst memory.
TrainSen	00001	 but it wasn't always the case.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not getting old so much as I had a lot of problems after being involved in a hit-and-run accident a few years ago.
TrainSen	00001	 Headaches and a somewhat irrational fear of cars.
TrainSen	00001	 I was in a car accident a few days ago, on my way to San Marcos to do some shopping.
TrainSen	00001	 My boyfriend was driving, the roads were wet and a car rammed us from behind.
TrainSen	00001	 What a nasty shock!.
TrainSen	00001	 At least no one was hurt, definitely not a major accident.
TrainSen	00001	 I left the TV on way too loud.
TrainSen	00001	 Funny how I sometimes like to be in a roomful of silence, and others I love background noises.
TrainSen	00001	 Leave the TV on just for ""company"".
TrainSen	00001	 Talk about true desperation.
TrainSen	00001	 CSI is on.
TrainSen	00001	 Love the show.
TrainSen	00001	 Absolutely fascinating.
TrainSen	00001	 I am such a TV addict, a skilful channel surfer, a couch potato with well developed curves; my belly and bottom.
TrainSen	00001	 Got an exam coming up on Monday, got to start studying for that.
TrainSen	00001	 Hope it's not too tough.
TrainSen	00001	 Gosh, I really miss home and family.
TrainSen	00001	 It's tough being away in a foreign land.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait to get back to Sydney and Singapore.
TrainSen	00001	 I am so looking forward to my trip in Europe at the end of the year.
TrainSen	00001	 I am so excited about Vienna and Italy.
TrainSen	00001	 I love to travel but things are always so different when you're actually living in a country.
TrainSen	00001	 It was hot out today.
TrainSen	00001	 I'll need to buy a fan for my apartment.
TrainSen	00001	 The ceiling fan just doesn't cut it.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm glad I missed most of summer, can't stand the heat.
TrainSen	00001	 Like winter so much better.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm hoping to see and play with lots of snow in Europe.
TrainSen	00001	 Have to admit that I don't really know what else to talk about.
TrainSen	00001	 I just know that I want to shower after this but knowing me, I'll probably end up lazing on the couch and watching more of the CSI marathon.
TrainSen	00001	 have to go pack my stuff later so I can continue the moving process.
TrainSen	00001	 My new apartment needs a lot of TLC before it will be in tip top shape.
TrainSen	00001	 Then again, only about three more months till I leave the states and am back on the road to Canada, Europe, Asia then Australia.
TrainSen	00001	 This year has been a most trying one.
TrainSen	00001	 But I know that I am a stronger and wiser person for it.
TrainSen	00001	 I've been through so much in life, but I know there's so much more.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm really hoping to have some time to visit my cousin in Harvard before I leave and a family friend in New York.
TrainSen	00001	 My body's cooling down, feeling a little chilly now.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I won't need/want that fan after all.
TrainSen	00001	 There's no need for it.
TrainSen	00001	 but wants are the way the world works.
TrainSen	00001	 I am almost there, just 2 more minutes left.
TrainSen	00001	 I really need to focus my time and attention on what I'm doing because of all the surrounding noises.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm actually speaking as I type.
TrainSen	00001	 Is that normal? Or more precisely, that's normal for me.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what Professor Pennebaker would say about what it means when people talk a fair amount to themselves, out loud.
TrainSen	00001	 Ok.
TrainSen	00001	 back to CSI.
TrainSen	10000	Yeah so I am so stressed right now and I am wishing that I wouldn't have eaten that popcorn because eating isn't exactly that best reaction to stress.
TrainSen	10000	 I could get FAT!!! I don't want to be fat.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean I know that college girls gain weight naturally and then they lose it after a few months at school! Right?!?!? But I am trying to run a lot!!!! That way, I can burn stress and burn calories.
TrainSen	10000	 EXTRA CALORIES!!! I am having a hard time not getting irritated when I eat a lot.
TrainSen	10000	 that's weird huh!? That it's when I am hungry that I'm not most irritable.
TrainSen	10000	 hmmmm well Today when I went running, I realized that I should have stretched because it's going to be hard to continue running everyday when I'm tight.
TrainSen	10000	 and get this! I've lost 5 lbs since I got to school.
TrainSen	10000	 But How?!?!? I've been everything in sight and building new leg muscle through running! Oh well.
TrainSen	10000	 Still I was kind of excited! But I am mad that I haven't started my period yet.
TrainSen	10000	 My mood swings are terrible and so are again.
TrainSen	10000	 My eating patterns! And that's when I find it hardest to study especially when the subject is something I don't like.
TrainSen	10000	 SPANISH!!! UGH! I want to move to Spain and learn it by living with people who speak it! But I really don't want to go to a class everyday where my instructor hardly knows English so she is slow to interpret and yet teach.
TrainSen	10000	 Does she really think that if she say's something over and over again that people will just ohhhhhh I've heard that word before.
TrainSen	10000	 and oh I know what it means! Poof! I mean we have to LEARN something before we can know it.
TrainSen	10000	 Did she know that she had to use a toilet on earth sooner or later when she came out of her Mother's womb.
TrainSen	10000	 NO! She was pottied trained.
TrainSen	10000	 RIGHT! Well My high school Spanish teacher was horrible and I had the worst experience with that .
TrainSen	10000	 while I got a great grade, I didn't learn that much which was really disappointing!!! I mean I am glad I got an A but she didn't prepare me for UT where my prof speaks in SPANISH all the time.
TrainSen	10000	 not just when she is interacting with us but when she is giving us instructions on how to understand it! Would I say to a baby.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok this is how you open your mouth.
TrainSen	10000	 open it open it.
TrainSen	10000	 Do you know what I am saying?!?! It kind of reminds me of those ignorant people that yell at people who can't speak English well.
TrainSen	10000	 they aren't trying to be mean but they may say ""HEY HOW ARE YOU"" really loudly and you're like ""Dude, they aren't deaf! They just don't know that words you are speaking or the way you say them might be very confusing to someone"" Right?!?! grr.
TrainSen	10000	 So I feel bad for whoever has to read this because they are going to be like ""MAN this girl is so negative!"" Golly, I am right now because I see my Spanish prof EVERYDAY! like I said before.
TrainSen	10000	 so yeah! uhhhhh well I am excited about this weekend but at the same time I keep thinking of how behind I am compared to everyone else here at UT, intellectually and academically! I mean I feel so insignificant some times.
TrainSen	10000	 However I know where I get my wisdom from and that is Jesus Christ who makes my knowing God possible! He saved me from the depths of HELL! And even after doubting him so much and having to research Jesus' life and creation and all that.
TrainSen	10000	 I have found that He is the one .
TrainSen	10000	 He is my sufficiency! I mean who knows more than the God of the universe, the creator of the heavens and I am so in awe in how he provides for me materially and more importantly Mentally, emotionally, Spiritually, and Intellectually! I mean who could know how to live like a human any better that the God that came to live like us at a point in time (point in time meaning 33 years roughly out of so many thousands of years) There is just so much opposition to him right now.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean there always has been obviously (that's why he was put to death.
TrainSen	10000	 well actually God let him die as a sacrifice for us!)but I just want everyone else to know his love and I really don't feel the need to push it off on anyone in a ""bible beating"" manner but just to love them through how I treat them.
TrainSen	10000	 Hopefully.
TrainSen	10000	 I wasn't too negative for .
TrainSen	10000	 you know what I'm just going to shut up and whoever reads this.
TrainSen	10000	 PLEASE LOOK FOR JESUS WITH THE PRE_SUPPOSITIONS that he doesn't exist.
TrainSen	00010	ok so I'm doing this stream of consciousness writing thing and its a little weird, but then again I love to type and just let loose on the computer what my mind is thinking.
TrainSen	00010	 so this is kind of fun.
TrainSen	00010	 I just wish that my strep throat/tonsillitis would go away so that tomorrow (Thursday) I can do well in the challenge.
TrainSen	00010	 and so that I can play well for the clarinet sectional Friday night, because I need to pass off the pregame music by memory and personally, I haven't memorized all of it yet.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess it comes from being an alternate, because half the time we practiced pregame (which hasn't been much) I was forced to sit on the sidelines and watch.
TrainSen	00010	 oh boy, don't I love watching.
TrainSen	00010	 I really hate just sitting there as an alternate, because I feel like I'm a cheap addition to the band.
TrainSen	00010	 like I wasn't quite good enough to deserve a marching spot.
TrainSen	00010	 but on the flip side, they must think that I'm good enough because I'm expected to jump in on game day and march pregame if someone is sick, late, drunk, or too hungover to march.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel bad for thinking this but I kind of want Kelvin's knee to keep him from marching on Saturday.
TrainSen	00010	 maybe he'll have me march pregame for him, since taps stride is a lot more painful.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't want to wish that pain on him, though, because he's a sweet guy and deserves to march every game.
TrainSen	00010	 plus he's a 5th year and he doesn't have many more games left.
TrainSen	00010	 thank god this room has finally warmed up.
TrainSen	00010	 or maybe its because I put some pants on.
TrainSen	00010	 do I smell smoke?? that wouldn't be good.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe Gina and I shouldn't leave the towels over the vent.
TrainSen	00010	 even though it is blocking the freaking cold air from coming through.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh my goodness this room is so cold in the morning!! holy cow you would think its January, not September! man, sleeping over at rustic's place last weekend was awesome.
TrainSen	00010	 I was warm the entire night, and when I got hot I just kicked the covers off until I got cold.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess the fact that I was wearing his pajama pants helped.
TrainSen	00010	 no nothing happened.
TrainSen	00010	 he's a really good guy.
TrainSen	00010	 A Christian.
TrainSen	00010	 his mom has a funny little story about premarital sex.
TrainSen	00010	 it has to deal with a unicorn.
TrainSen	00010	 Yeah I wont go into details.
TrainSen	00010	 but it proves that he's a good guy.
TrainSen	00010	 not to mention I spent both Friday and Saturday nights at his place.
TrainSen	00010	 he didn't try a single thing! funny how dad thinks I trust guys too much, and make myself too 'available'.
TrainSen	00010	 if only he knew me better, he would know that I'm VERY skeptical with guys.
TrainSen	00010	 especially after so many of them lying to me.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm sick of being cheated on and lied to, so I basically play hard to get.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think id consider it that, but I don't go easy on them.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not the stupid blonde you think I am.
TrainSen	00010	 I really wish I was one or two steps up on the ladder.
TrainSen	00010	 my whole life I felt like I wasn't quite good enough.
TrainSen	00010	 I never won any student council positions, never quite made it to area band, made first chair wind last year on account of a new director but lost it the next semester, made alternate up here at UT, and wasn't elected as Newman representative.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't understand it.
TrainSen	00010	 I work my ass off to do the best I can, but that never seems to be good enough.
TrainSen	00010	 why? my dad was valedictorian at his high school, and if I had good grades in elementary school where did the smarts go? why did I all of a sudden screw up math class in 7th grade? granted mrs glover refused to help me, and probably told me the wrong way to solve problems, but still.
TrainSen	00010	 I did awesome in 8th grade prealgebra, and then algebra and geometry in high school.
TrainSen	00010	 but once I hit algebra 2 and precal, shit hit the fan.
TrainSen	00010	 I just hope I don't have to take calculus in college.
TrainSen	00010	 but since I don't know what I want to do, I may have to.
TrainSen	00010	 I really need to get that career test done.
TrainSen	00010	 I've got to figure out what I want to do with myself by next semester.
TrainSen	00010	 unless I stay in liberal arts, this whole semester has practically been a waste.
TrainSen	00010	 not quite, because bio psy and band count (for nursing at least), but other than that.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know what I want to do.
TrainSen	00010	 what do people do if they can't decide? take a lot of random classes I guess, but that's not me.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm coming in with so many hours that I was hoping to graduate in 3 years.
TrainSen	00010	 that way if I go to law school I can get in and out before I'm 30, ugly, and still single.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope I meet someone up here.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not built to be single or to date for years to come.
TrainSen	00010	 ahh nose needs to stop itching.
TrainSen	00010	 why the heck do I have to be sick? I hate this! once hell week was done I got sick.
TrainSen	00010	 yeah, that makes the first week of school start off real good.
TrainSen	00010	 let me tell you.
TrainSen	00010	 oh well.
TrainSen	00010	 at least I did all the partying last weekend, before all the symptoms hit.
TrainSen	00010	 and before my parents decided to come in.
TrainSen	00010	 dangit! rustin has a kappa kappa psi thing at 8am Sunday morning, which means he probably wont party after the game Saturday night, which means I wont get to spend the night at his apartment because he wont be able to get up and take me back to my dorm at that obnoxious hour.
TrainSen	00010	 oh but maybe after we paint his living room on Monday I could stay over.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't have a class until 12:30 so that might work! jeez I'm a dork.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to stop reading into things like this.
TrainSen	00010	 the time will come when it decides to come.
TrainSen	00010	 until then I got to sit back and watch things happen.
TrainSen	00010	 oh look, I have 10 seconds left.
TrainSen	01000	It's only the second week of school, actually the first full week and I'm already so stressed out from studying.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not sure exactly how to study but I'm learning.
TrainSen	01000	 I think maybe I should just make study guides so that's what I'm doing.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh my gosh, I got to eat at the nicest restaurant last night, TrueLuck's.
TrainSen	01000	 It was so good and I had such a good time.
TrainSen	01000	 This past Saturday I wanted to go home so bad and was trying to get my boyfriend to come meet me in Waco to eat.
TrainSen	01000	 It didn't happen but in the long run I'm glad because I finally made some friends.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm the kind of person who likes to have a lot of friends to hang out with and usually they are mostly guys.
TrainSen	01000	 Though this doesn't much help my boyfriend's peace of mind.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not sure my roommate is that way but whatever.
TrainSen	01000	 Anyway, well I met these really cool guys who I really like hanging out with.
TrainSen	01000	 Sometimes I don't think Ashley likes them as much and it pisses me off because it makes me feel like she thinks I'm wrong to hang with guys because I have a boyfriend and so does she and well we're just really different.
TrainSen	01000	 Well these guys ended up needing dates to a dinner for their fraternity so we said we'd go, I think Ashley only said yes because she had been drinking.
TrainSen	01000	 Well I had so much fun and the guy I went with turned out to be really nice.
TrainSen	01000	 It was great to finally go out and do something with people.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel more at home now.
TrainSen	01000	 Now to my boyfriend.
TrainSen	01000	 We were best friends for 2 years before we even thought about dating.
TrainSen	01000	 I love him so much and although I'm only 18 I pretty much believe he's the guy I'm suppose to be with when I get married.
TrainSen	01000	 But my going away to college has been hard on both of us and in some ways harder on him.
TrainSen	01000	 I understand that he's back home and doing the same things he's done for 3 years so he doesn't have as many things to keep his mind of missing me as I do but before we never argued and now he's always mad at me about something.
TrainSen	01000	 He makes me feel awful when I go out and I know he doesn't mean to but it happens.
TrainSen	01000	 He can't understand where I'm coming from.
TrainSen	01000	 The guy I dated never cried every night and now he does and it gets depressing and makes me feel guilty.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to have fun here without knowing that he's at home mad or crying.
TrainSen	01000	 He's not the crying type of guy so I just don't understand.
TrainSen	01000	 I love him more than anything and he should realize that, that is all that matters.
TrainSen	01000	 No other guy here will ever take his place but that doesn't mean that I won't make other guy friends and go out with them.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't even look at guys the same way because of Brent.
TrainSen	01000	 My life here does not mean that what I feel in my heart is suddenly going to change.
TrainSen	01000	 I just wish that he would go back to being the same Brent as before I left but I know that it is going to take time and I just need to realize this just as much as he needs to realize how bad he's making me feel.
TrainSen	01000	 It's a compromise situation but I think everyone should have to go through this because if we're still together in the long run I know our relationship will be just that much stronger.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm going home this weekend and I can't wait finally I can show Brent that my feelings for him are the same and I get to see my mom and sister.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to go to my dad's and since he just moved out a few weeks ago it will be my first time to go and I'm not really looking forward to it.
TrainSen	01000	 I want things to go back to normal with my family.
TrainSen	01000	 The way it's suppose to be.
TrainSen	01000	 If there is such a thing.
TrainSen	01000	 The months before coming to college were so hard and stressful that at times I'm glad I'm here and away from all of it.
TrainSen	01000	 At least I don't have to listen to the screaming and fighting.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish my mom would try to fight for my dad and like lose weight or something.
TrainSen	01000	 But she's being stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss my sister so much and my dog Tinker.
TrainSen	01000	 My sister and I are so close we might as well be twins so I hate being away from her.
TrainSen	00001	The crotheres computer lab is perhaps one of the worst on campus, but I don't really know since I have been to only three.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm real glad that I got into the college of communications.
TrainSen	00001	 Its unfortunate, however, that I can't spell worth anything.
TrainSen	00001	 Jeez, I hope this writing assignment is not graded on spelling or grammar or any of that sort of nonsense.
TrainSen	00001	 Why is it oh so hot in here? honestly, every other building on campus is freezing, but in here, I just want to wear beach clothes.
TrainSen	00001	 I remember when I went to the beach for the first time in my life.
TrainSen	00001	 It was this past summer.
TrainSen	00001	 Myrtle Beach.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh family vacations.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope my mom and pop are doing ok at home.
TrainSen	00001	 Since I'm gone they only have each other to yell at.
TrainSen	00001	 no more marjon for yell fest 2004 at the rostami household.
TrainSen	00001	 Good people.
TrainSen	00001	 They just need to get out more.
TrainSen	00001	 This keyboard kind of sucks too.
TrainSen	00001	 Some of the keys get suck and it is oh so inconvenient.
TrainSen	00001	 There we go with the spelling again.
TrainSen	00001	 In the eighth grade my English teacher once told me that spelling is not a sign of a gifted student.
TrainSen	00001	 At the end of the year she gave me the award for best student.
TrainSen	00001	 Yep.
TrainSen	00001	 English has always been a good one.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I make the staff of the daily Texan.
TrainSen	00001	 They emailed me today and told me that I had to write another column.
TrainSen	00001	 Can't they tell just how amazing I am from only one column? I guess not.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to be more creative.
TrainSen	00001	 Creative like all those communication kids.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm ONE TOO!!! YAYAYAY! Yes sir, all the cool kids are communications majors.
TrainSen	00001	 AT orientation a radio station person told me I was a cool kid.
TrainSen	00001	 This city makes my face break out big time.
TrainSen	00001	 My skin is horrible, and I hate having to scratch  my skin when my fingers have been typing and I most obviously have contracted all sorts of bacteria that I am now rubbing on my face.
TrainSen	00001	 OH my face.
TrainSen	00001	 The communications kids I interviewed with today (the Texan) had bad skin too.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I'll fit in swell with them.
TrainSen	00001	 If I just get in.
TrainSen	00001	 OH man oh man oh manoh man.
TrainSen	00001	 I really hope I make the staff.
TrainSen	00001	 I find out on Thursday.
TrainSen	00001	 I also have to submit another column by Thursday.
TrainSen	00001	 I had a teacher once who had really long nasty nails and a nose ring (those weren't common until a few years ago.
TrainSen	00001	 then everyone started getting them, including white kids.
TrainSen	00001	 I am white.
TrainSen	00001	 My people are from the caucus mountains and you just don't get any more caucasion than and Iranian.
TrainSen	00001	 again with the spelling.
TrainSen	00001	 and again with the messed up keys.
TrainSen	00001	 I should have just gone to use the computers in the ugl or the cma or cmc, whichever one has computers.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought not having a computer would be a major hassle, but it is pretty decent so far.
TrainSen	00001	 knock on wood! My hands are dry.
TrainSen	00001	 That's another think about this city, it makes my skin dry.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe that's why my skin is breaking out so hardcore-because it is so dry that it is producing more oils to balance out my skin tone but it just proves to be detrimental to my skin.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh shoot.
TrainSen	00001	 I never cared about my appearance.
TrainSen	00001	 I was the homecoming queen.
TrainSen	00001	 Me.
TrainSen	00001	 not some ""popular slut.
TrainSen	00001	 "" Man, there are so many sorority girls in this school.
TrainSen	00001	 At the beginning of school I mistakenly walked through the area in front of the ugl and walked through a mass of girls who all looked the exact same!! WHERE IS YOUR IDENTITY LITTLE GIRL? they have none.
TrainSen	00001	 My phone just vibrated.
TrainSen	00001	 It could be my mom.
TrainSen	00001	 she calls a lot now that my sister and I are out of the house all she has to talk to is my pop, and well, he is not one to talk.
TrainSen	00001	 LAME.
TrainSen	00001	 Or it could be some fool from my high school warning me of the fat pagan.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate her, if it is one person who I hate it is jenny pagan: my theatre teacher for 4 years and I had her twice a day.
TrainSen	00001	 YUCK! Jesus I hate her.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm going back home on the 24th to crown the new queen and I might have to see her and a whole lot of people I don't want to see for the rest of my life.
TrainSen	00001	 Including Steven, the king.
TrainSen	00001	 My ex best friend, and my ex boy friend.
TrainSen	00001	 (again with the spelling, I do realize all that is one word, but I am hesitant to go back an change it because I am at 18 minutes and 7 seconds right now.
TrainSen	00001	 I love this kind of writing, we should do it all the time, always.
TrainSen	00001	 Landon used to always say that.
TrainSen	00001	 A good man, that Landon Phillips.
TrainSen	00001	 Too bad some girl named Roxy had to go and taint such a good man.
TrainSen	00001	 I had a lot of friends who were boys in high school, but not in college.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe that is because I live in Littlefield.
TrainSen	00001	 Ladybugs! oh man, I like to steal the doormat and put it in front of other peoples doors.
TrainSen	10000	Yesterday, I went tubing with my family on the Guadalupe river.
TrainSen	10000	 It was a blast!  It was the first time since I moved to college on Ague.
TrainSen	10000	 20th that I have spent time with my mom and sister.
TrainSen	10000	 They are the two people that I miss the most back home and I was so happy and relaxed to get to spend time with them.
TrainSen	10000	 I also got to see my little baby puppy bichon frise named Bebe who is absolutely spoiled rotten.
TrainSen	10000	 It was weird going home and sleeping in my own bed for a night but it was also a great get away from school to just hang out with my family.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess that I have been putting off any kind of homesickness by staying busy with school and trying to meet as many people as possible.
TrainSen	10000	 I find that the more that I see my family the more I think about them and get sad so.
TrainSen	10000	 I am refraining from going home for just that reason.
TrainSen	10000	 I am waiting to find out if I am going to get an interview from the Texas Spirits and I have mixed feelings on whether or not I want to join.
TrainSen	10000	 Part of my doesn't want to be joining an organization I am not 100% interested just because I am looking to meet some new cool people, but on the other hand I need to get involved in something at UT so that I can find so sense of belonging in this large school.
TrainSen	10000	 I definitely am worried that if I get busy with an organization I would overstress about my classes and meeting the clubs requirements as a member.
TrainSen	10000	 Deep down I know that most of my worries are pretty trivial compared to most peoples problems.
TrainSen	10000	 I know that I am  very lucky just to get the chance to go to college and that is why I am so concerned on whether or not I am going to blow it.
TrainSen	10000	 I am very concerned about my Chemistry class and I  have been thinking about how much I need to study all weekend.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 Well, two classes ago we discussed on a scale from 1-10, what is your fear of death.
TrainSen	10000	 My feels like it is 20.
TrainSen	10000	 This is not because I lack a faith that their is a higher being or an after life, it is because I am afraid of losing someone I care about while I am away at school.
TrainSen	10000	 I have been thinking a lot about a friend of mine who was going to be a sophomore at UT this year who passes away suddenly from a pulmonary embolism/clot.
TrainSen	10000	 I am now grieving the loss of someone so young and so beautiful that I feel that my sense of security has been ripped away from me.
TrainSen	10000	 I am now thinking if someone so healthy and young can lose their life so suddenly, whose to say that the couldn't be my brother/sister or mother/father.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess that you could say that I am one of those people who worry to much and I worry that I will lose someone again and I wouldn't have had the chance to say goodbye.
TrainSen	10000	 Anyways, this all sounds so childish and ""heavy"" for an 18 year old college student to be thinking about.
TrainSen	10000	 Well I am so happy that these 20 min.
TrainSen	10000	 have flown by and I can get to my real homework.
TrainSen	10000	 It really felt go to get all of my thoughts out in a way that was quick and easy.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope that I can get all of my work done tonight so that I don't get behind this week.
TrainSen	10000	 This was a great assignment, I would not mind doing more of these.
TrainSen	00100	I feel so blessed to be here right now.
TrainSen	00100	 the game tonight was so fun.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't believe that we won 65-0.
TrainSen	00100	 that's such an incredible win.
TrainSen	00100	 poor north Texas guys.
TrainSen	00100	 They must feel pretty embarrassed.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel so content here and settled even though I've only been here a couple of weeks.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that I am really getting comfortable with all of my classes and the people around me and am really getting to feel like this is my home.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss judd so much.
TrainSen	00100	 the time we get to spend together is never enough.
TrainSen	00100	 its funny to me how I haven't missed my parents at all but I think about and miss judd all the time.
TrainSen	00100	 I just love the way he makes me feel, so warm and so complete.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm so glad that I have friends here like oshley and that I totally lucked out with allyson as my roommate.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm so relieved that me and my friend ben worked out the awkwardness between us so that we're still good friends.
TrainSen	00100	 I was so surprised when I saw him on the jumbotron tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel so proud of him.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't stop thinking about how lucky I feel to be here.
TrainSen	00100	 I just love it here and can't wait till judd gets here.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I want to convince all my friends still in high school to go to school here.
TrainSen	00100	 Its just so amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 the people and the opportunities and the culture make this place so amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 living in new braunfels was such a bubble.
TrainSen	00100	 this feels more like the real world.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that people say college is still a bubble and I think they're right, but its more of a realistic world than life in new braunfels.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss high school, but just the idea of knowing everybody and where everything was and the comfort of it being my hometown.
TrainSen	00100	 at the game last night, I felt a little sad that I wasn't down there on the track cheering.
TrainSen	00100	 now that judd and I were together, part of me wishes I could go back and have that ultimately typical high school relationship - the varsity football player and the varsity cheerleader.
TrainSen	00100	 it would've been so much fun to have that sort of experience!  I'm just a little jealous of those girls down there on the track because I feel like they aren't taking advantage of what an incredible opportunity they've got down there.
TrainSen	00100	 those were the best times of my life thus far.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that better are sure to come in my years here at Texas, but I just wish that I could go back, just for one Friday night, and cheer under the lights and yell for the boys and be right down there with judd.
TrainSen	00100	 it makes me so sad that I probably won't ever get to perform like that again.
TrainSen	00100	 my dancing and cheering days are over and I just want them back.
TrainSen	00100	 its not that I miss the actual belonging to the cheerleading program, I just miss being in the spotlight and performing for the fans.
TrainSen	00100	 I thrive off of that and now I feel a little empty since I don't get to do it anymore, and I especially feel it when I see the new girls down there on the track.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel kind of dumb reminiscing so much on high school memories now that I'm in college because all I ever talked about in high school was how I couldn't wait to get away from the drama and just come to college to be just a normal student.
TrainSen	00100	 granted I definitely don't miss the drama of high school, I do miss the girls and the games of high school cheerleading.
TrainSen	00100	  the more I keep thinking about this the more sad I feel.
TrainSen	00100	 I think the biggest problem is how much I miss judd.
TrainSen	00100	 we spent so much time together this summer and I just miss him not always being there to hold whenever and wherever I needed him.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't believe I fell in love with him.
TrainSen	00100	 he's just an amazing guy.
TrainSen	00100	 the one thing that scares me about him that makes me feel nervous is his uncertainty about his Christianity.
TrainSen	00100	 its so hard for me to explain my faith to him because it was just engrained in me and I was too young to question it and now its just a part of who I am and I'm so thankful for that.
TrainSen	00100	 but judd didn't grow up going to church or with any faith instilled in him so now its hard for him to understand or trust anything that he can't prove really is there.
TrainSen	00100	 I think its a matter of pride.
TrainSen	00100	 The idea of giving himself to someone else that he doesn't really know is there doesn't settle well with him.
TrainSen	00100	 or maybe its a trust issue.
TrainSen	00100	 Or maybe both.
TrainSen	00100	 its just hard because I can't really understand how he can NOT have belief, and he doesn't understand how I CAN.
TrainSen	00100	 oh man I have a lot of homework this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 I really have to finish it all tomorrow so I can go home and see judd.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait to see him tomorrow.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish he could be up here experiencing all this with me.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait for him to come to school up here and be with me! that will totally complete me here.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know if I'm complete without him.
TrainSen	00100	 I've never felt dependent on someone like that before.
TrainSen	00100	 well I think my time is almost up.
TrainSen	00100	 in conclusion, I feel so amazed that I'm actually here.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my friends who aren't here, and I especially miss judd.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to work hard here and prove myself to everyone and make really good grades and fully experience everything ut has to offer.
TrainSen	00010	Well where should I start.
TrainSen	00010	 First of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that I have ever had to do.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not even sure what to write about.
TrainSen	00010	 My day started at 6:30 today because I have an 8 o'clock class which is really fun.
TrainSen	00010	 not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less.
TrainSen	00010	 then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun.
TrainSen	00010	 then I had a break from 10 to 3:30 which would really suck if I didn't have plans.
TrainSen	00010	 so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I'm flag football team.
TrainSen	00010	 well anyway, I'm not even sure if I'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today.
TrainSen	00010	 any way I really enjoyed today's material in class.
TrainSen	00010	 at first I wasn't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now.
TrainSen	00010	 Considering that I have and extremely hot instructor for my RHE 306 class.
TrainSen	00010	 Its crazy hot attractive she is.
TrainSen	00010	 But now I'm thinking about another girl that I have a crush on.
TrainSen	00010	 Today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not sure if she knows how I feel, but I'm having a hard time reading her.
TrainSen	00010	 Usually I'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier.
TrainSen	00010	 I also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because I had been wanting to talk to them for a while.
TrainSen	00010	 Things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes.
TrainSen	00010	 I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind.
TrainSen	00010	 On yeah, I got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad.
TrainSen	00010	 My dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work.
TrainSen	00010	 My mom called on her way to a Bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl I have crush on this weekend since she is going home Friday.
TrainSen	00010	 anyway crush is such a high school word now, what I really meant was girl I'm attracted to.
TrainSen	00010	 What's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since I was in 10th grade.
TrainSen	00010	 and every time she would tell me I would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that I'm into her it kind of sucks because now I have to put much more effort into it.
TrainSen	00010	 Now don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to make it seem like I'm am lazy but I truly am not used to putting in so much work.
TrainSen	00010	 I know it may sound cockeye but if it does I'm sorry, please don't think of me like that.
TrainSen	00010	 what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or I'll type and you'll read later.
TrainSen	00100	Well today I went with my friend Kai to his Texas Crew orientation.
TrainSen	00100	 He tried to get me to join, but I just don't think that Crew would be the sport for me.
TrainSen	00100	 I prefer to play volleyball above all other sports.
TrainSen	00100	 Just this past week, I signed up for the volleyball teams here at UT.
TrainSen	00100	 I would really enjoy to play for the school, or at least on a team, competing with others.
TrainSen	00100	 I used to play volleyball every weekend with my family back in Houston, I guess that's why I like it so much.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss being around my family, but I know that they are proud of me for being here at UT.
TrainSen	00100	 I wanted to go back this weekend, since it's a 3 day weekend, unfortunately, I am a little behind in my classes, so I wanted to take advantage of this time to  catch up and maybe get ahead a little.
TrainSen	00100	 The reason which I am behind in my classes, which is so unlike me, is probably because I am having trouble reading and concentrating at the same time.
TrainSen	00100	 I believe that this is happening because of the long summer.
TrainSen	00100	 Well just now my ex-boyfriend instant-messaged me, which for some reason I have been avoiding.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess because I don't want anything to do with him, I don't even consider him a good friend.
TrainSen	00100	 Just now, my friend whom which I met through Hang Out, a gay organization here on campus, instant-messaged me asking me to go out.
TrainSen	00100	 He has been taking me out, to places I wouldn't even think of going, since I arrived here at UT.
TrainSen	00100	 Now him I do consider him a good friend.
TrainSen	00100	 He is a really good guy, really fun to be around with.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know if I am starting to develop feelings for him, which would not be a good thing at all since he is about to leave the school.
TrainSen	00100	 I spent last night at his house, just hanging out, talking about whatever came to our minds, and fell asleep on his bed.
TrainSen	00100	 Nothing happened, but for some reason, I sort of wanted something to.
TrainSen	00100	 I believe that I wanted something to happen because I have been feeling very lonely these past few days, maybe because of I need a boyfriend, or the whole owing the bank money and not having any to give, or not going home for the weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 Or maybe I just genuinely like him.
TrainSen	00100	 Well I guess we will soon find out because my scholarship check arrived at my house in Houston 2 days ago, and my mom is going to mail it to me, and if all goes as planned, I will be able to keep the money for myself, if financial aid allows me to.
TrainSen	00100	 So I will use that money to pay off my bank bill.
TrainSen	00100	 And today, my mom called, and I felt like I was there even though we are 3 hours away, which took away my wanting to go there for this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 Right now, I don't want a boyfriend for various reasons.
TrainSen	00100	 One, I have decided to put off sex until I get tested for HIV.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't have suspicions that I may have it, but I have had unprotected sex, and so I just want to be sure.
TrainSen	00100	 Second, I need to stay focused on my school work, and having a boyfriend may distract me.
TrainSen	00100	 Third, I just don't know if I can handle going through what I went through with my ex all over again.
TrainSen	00100	 Not that it would necessarily happen again, but I just don't want to take the risk.
TrainSen	00100	 Or maybe I should just be brave and take a risk.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to do a lot of soul searching to come up with my decision.
TrainSen	01000	As I sit in this library for the first time in my entire life, I feel as if I don't belong here, in this setting.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not usually the completely studious type so I'm just trying this library thing out.
TrainSen	01000	 It's really deathly quiet and I'm not used to the absolute silence that surrounds me.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel quite rude as my typing is unusually loud in this setting.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope people around me aren't annoyed by this ""tapping"" as I am.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm sitting alone in the corner, but at least I'm next to the window.
TrainSen	01000	 I picked this spot as to not go completely crazy and be bored.
TrainSen	01000	 People watching is fun.
TrainSen	01000	 it's interesting to me how every single person walking around outside has their own story, their own point of view and I often wonder how different it is from my own.
TrainSen	01000	 I haven't had any quiet time or alone time to myself since I've moved up here to Austin and just now, I realize that I indeed do miss it.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I'll visit the library by myself a lot more often from now on.
TrainSen	01000	 next time, I should remember to bring a jacket; I feel like I'm turning into a humansicle.
TrainSen	01000	 but I don't like walking all the way from my dorm to here.
TrainSen	01000	 it's quite a walk.
TrainSen	01000	 I really should learn how to use the bus system here.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm used to having the comfort of my car.
TrainSen	01000	 the comfort I've had for four years.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss it.
TrainSen	01000	 I went home this weekend, the very first weekend after school started.
TrainSen	01000	 it's not because I missed home or I was homesick or anything.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been away from home for much longer periods of time and have never even thought about home much.
TrainSen	01000	 like this summer, my 5 weeks overseas, I don't think I even thought about my family or home-life all that much.
TrainSen	01000	 As horrible as that sounds, I'm not the type to miss my family or anything.
TrainSen	01000	 anyway, I just went home this weekend because I felt that my dorm room was too bland and I wanted to bring up more stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 I ended up coming back up to school with a huge suitcase and three boxes worth of crap that I should have thrown away.
TrainSen	01000	 instead, this wonderful crap adorns my newly decorated dorm room walls and desk area.
TrainSen	01000	 it looks so much better.
TrainSen	01000	 I also got a new webcam.
TrainSen	01000	 my mother had one at home that I wanted to bring up but she said she used it a lot so she ended up buying me another one.
TrainSen	01000	 My mother's a funny person.
TrainSen	01000	 She came to the states during her college years about 20-something years ago.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how her college experience was.
TrainSen	01000	 It must have been hard.
TrainSen	01000	 I can imagine living in a country where no one understands what the heck you're saying.
TrainSen	01000	 I've experienced it.
TrainSen	01000	 still, she managed pretty well, I suspect.
TrainSen	01000	 she's just that type of person.
TrainSen	01000	 she has a really strange accent though in her English.
TrainSen	01000	 Normally, Asian people have a really ""fobbish"" horrible sounding accent but she has a peculiar twang to it to make it sound incredibly different.
TrainSen	01000	 It's not a perfect English accent but it sounds slightly European.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know why.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom is a very peculiar person.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, going back to the webcam thing.
TrainSen	01000	 I think one day I was using her computer at home and I looked at her picture folder.
TrainSen	01000	 There were all these webcam shots of her smiling and trying to look cute in several different outfits.
TrainSen	01000	 I almost fell out of my chair laughing.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom is so cute.
TrainSen	01000	 I believe she chats more than I do online to her friends.
TrainSen	01000	 We've never chatted before but now that I'm not home, we've started to talk online through MSN messenger.
TrainSen	01000	 It's incredibly awkward and a strange experience but I'm sure I'll be accustomed to it soon.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom's awesome.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how many of my friend's moms chat online to them.
TrainSen	01000	 NO ONE.
TrainSen	01000	 well, no one that I've met anyway.
TrainSen	01000	 Now I've run out of things to say so I'm slowly gazing around this room.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm next to a beigish wall.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't think I enjoy the color beige too much.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I had better posture.
TrainSen	01000	 typing on the computer makes me slouch.
TrainSen	01000	 sitting back while reading makes me slouch.
TrainSen	01000	 eating makes me slouch.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I'm just a natural sloucher.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to grow at least two more inches though.
TrainSen	01000	 I look taller if I'd stand up straight but it's so hard.
TrainSen	01000	 I also heard stretching makes you taller.
TrainSen	01000	 I should try that sometime.
TrainSen	01000	 I always say I'll start things and never do.
TrainSen	01000	 Or usually I start things that I never finish.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if it's a kind of disorder.
TrainSen	01000	 there are a lot of books on the shelf that look amazingly old.
TrainSen	01000	 I should go flip through some of them before I leave.
TrainSen	01000	 they look interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 I like that old book smell.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know why.
TrainSen	01000	 it'll probably make me sneeze.
TrainSen	01000	 someone just walked past me and we both sort of glanced at each other.
TrainSen	01000	 I should have smiled or something.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel so rude and mean.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I look mean when I feel emotionless or I'm not making any faces on purpose.
TrainSen	01000	 my mom says Asians naturally look angry all the time.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe it's true.
TrainSen	01000	 I should smile more often but then I feel like an idiot if someone sees me just smiling to myself.
TrainSen	01000	 oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 it's college now, I'm sure nobody cares and there are weirder people than me here anyway.
TrainSen	01000	 time's up, I'm done.
TrainSen	00001	OK, so I'm sick and I don't feel good.
TrainSen	00001	 But I feel better than yesterday and last night.
TrainSen	00001	 I woke up about a million times last night feeling horrible and my temperature just kept climbing.
TrainSen	00001	 I finally took some Tylenol at about 4am this morning and I woke up later sweating, so I hope that means I broke the fever.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I just have this stupid cough to worry about.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate coughing because it hurts my throat.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to call my voice teacher and tell her I can't come to lessons today because I'm sick.
TrainSen	00001	 Which sucks because I haven't had a lesson in forever.
TrainSen	00001	 And she's the best teacher I've ever had.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess keeping the extra money is good.
TrainSen	00001	 Ugh.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm coughing again.
TrainSen	00001	 It sucks.
TrainSen	00001	 My dog is looking out the window.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a lot of studying that I need to do today.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to catch up on a bunch of stuff so that I hopefully can go to Dallas tomorrow to see Sister Hazel in concert again.
TrainSen	00001	 But I seriously don't know if I'll be able to go since I'm sick.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm on medicine, so hopefully getting another round in me today will help.
TrainSen	00001	 Goodness this stupid clock is going so slow.
TrainSen	00001	 I've only been typing for 4 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 I think 20 minutes is a bit excessive.
TrainSen	00001	 There's not even a pause button.
TrainSen	00001	 What is I have to go to the bathroom or someone comes to the door.
TrainSen	00001	 Seriously.
TrainSen	00001	 Plus, I want to lay down.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to get something to eat and take my medicine.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to call my voice teacher.
TrainSen	00001	 So, I want to go to Dallas this weekend but I also want to stay to go to some stuff that's going on down here.
TrainSen	00001	 Mostly because the guy I have a crush on will be there too.
TrainSen	00001	 And he's been giving me very mixed signals lately.
TrainSen	00001	 Which is so frustrating.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know what to think or how to act around him.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm trying to act almost aloof, as if I don't care.
TrainSen	00001	 Part of me thinks he's just toying with me to stoke his own ego.
TrainSen	00001	 And I refuse to play into anyone's ego.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't want to get hurt.
TrainSen	00001	 It sucks.
TrainSen	00001	 And this cooler weather is reminding me of couples.
TrainSen	00001	 Being able to snuggle and all that.
TrainSen	00001	 Not that I've ever had that.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm 22 and I've never had a boyfriend.
TrainSen	00001	 Which is OK.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't define my self worth by a guy or if I've had a boyfriend or not.
TrainSen	00001	 But sometimes I do think it world be nice.
TrainSen	00001	 But it's whatever God has planned for me.
TrainSen	00001	 If He thinks I'm not ready, then I'm not ready.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to start spending more time with God.
TrainSen	00001	 Just get my focus back on Him.
TrainSen	00001	 So many things have happened these past few weeks and I feel that they've all been for a reason.
TrainSen	00001	 And I'm graduating in December and I have no idea what I'm going to do.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm excited and terrified at the same time.
TrainSen	00001	 Will I get a job?  Where will it be?  Will I like it?  Will I actually get to end up doing what I want to do?  Why am I so scared to put myself out there sometimes?  The worst that can be said to me is no.
TrainSen	00001	 There are always other options.
TrainSen	00001	 If you want something, you've got to spend that time and effort it takes to make it happen.
TrainSen	00001	 So I just called to cancel my voice lessons and my voice teacher is going to charge me for this week anyways because its a ""late cancellation.
TrainSen	00001	 ""  Well, I know that, but it's not like I knew I was going to be running a fever.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean, seriously.
TrainSen	00001	 Have a little compassion.
TrainSen	00001	 And my stupid thermometer just ran out of batteries.
TrainSen	00001	 So now I can't even take my temp anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 Guess that means I'll be making a Wal-Mart run later today.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to get some more Vicks Vapor rub anyways.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate being sick.
TrainSen	00001	 I've always thought of myself as a singer and singers can't sing when they're sick.
TrainSen	00001	 OK, only a minute and a half left.
TrainSen	00001	 I can do this.
TrainSen	00001	 I can get through it.
TrainSen	00001	 If my cough doesn't kill me first.
TrainSen	00001	 Blue skies, shining on me, nothing but blue skies do I see!  My dog is barking at something.
TrainSen	00001	 She's loud and it's annoying.
TrainSen	00001	 I need a drink of water.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to be well.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to study.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to do a bible study.
TrainSen	01000	So yesterday my boyfriend from A&M came down to Austin to celebrate our 9 month anniversary.
TrainSen	01000	 It was a lot of fun but I stayed up late so I'm pretty tired.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate that feeling of no energy and I just want to sleep but I know I can't because I am so stressed out.
TrainSen	01000	 I am still really adjusting to college life.
TrainSen	01000	 It's is so different from high school and its not all that it's worked up to be.
TrainSen	01000	 I really like all the freedom, along with everyone else, but I am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying.
TrainSen	01000	 I am only taking 14 hrs.
TrainSen	01000	 , which is supposedly and easy load, but I feel so bogged down.
TrainSen	01000	 I tell myself I am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up.
TrainSen	01000	 I have so much I want to do but there are not enough hours in the day.
TrainSen	01000	 But everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust.
TrainSen	01000	 I just don't hope it will reflect in my grades.
TrainSen	01000	 I thought I had a calculus test next Friday, but I came to find out today that it is nest Wednesday.
TrainSen	01000	 That is really scary.
TrainSen	01000	 Bit I took calculus my senior year in high school so I feel I know some of the stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 Everyone studies hardcore for tests, which I am pretty nervous about.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't really do to much homework in that class because I have so much to do in my other classes.
TrainSen	01000	 I really hope I'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student doesn't type super fast so my paper looks really short and that I didn't try.
TrainSen	01000	 Anyways, I have a problem with the nest football game which is TX vs.
TrainSen	01000	 Rice.
TrainSen	01000	 I didn't realize they sold the tickets so early.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess the draw started yesterday.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go but I haven't really met a lot of close friends to go with.
TrainSen	01000	 This guy friend from high school wants me to go but I really want to go with a big group of people.
TrainSen	01000	 I have never been to a large football game.
TrainSen	01000	 Actually the only games I have gone to have been my high school games.
TrainSen	01000	 But my high school had like 3,000 people so it was a big school.
TrainSen	01000	 A lot of the seniors from our school went to A&M because it's only an hour away.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this.
TrainSen	01000	 I am originally from California, which was so pretty, and Houston isn't the prettiest place in the world.
TrainSen	01000	 I forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me.
TrainSen	01000	 It is getting really annoying.
TrainSen	01000	 Seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now.
TrainSen	01000	 I like it but some people are obsessed with it.
TrainSen	01000	 But I guess I am obsessed with my cell phone.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't even use any other phone.
TrainSen	01000	 I am always on it.
TrainSen	01000	 I think it is so funny when you walk to class and everyone is on  their cells.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I have to take mine to and call someone so of course I do.
TrainSen	01000	 Plus, walking to class gets kind of lonely.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like these thoughts pop in my head and I then I go in a tangent to try to type.
TrainSen	01000	 But then my mind goes blank for a second.
TrainSen	01000	 I never really thought I was a good writer.
TrainSen	01000	 In fact, I thought I was horrible.
TrainSen	01000	 My teachers never gave me feedback and I never felt comfortable sharing my papers in class.
TrainSen	01000	 It wasn't until the end of my senior year, my English teacher told the whole class that I was one of the best writers in the class.
TrainSen	01000	 I really thank her for that because that really boosted my confidence and I feel like I do write well.
TrainSen	01000	 It almost makes me look forward to writing instead of procrastinating like I do everything else.
TrainSen	01000	 My critical thinking teacher said that is the number one regret for students after their first semester.
TrainSen	01000	 I believe him because it is so hard not to procrastinate.
TrainSen	01000	 I try not to since it's such a bad thing, but I guess it's just human nature.
TrainSen	10000	Wow, I have some pizza stuck in my tooth.
TrainSen	10000	 Aw, why did that song have to end, it was good.
TrainSen	10000	 the AC is really loud.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I like shrek 2.
TrainSen	10000	 tonight, I'm breaking the habit tonight, I like Kelly Clarkson, she's so talented.
TrainSen	10000	 man, I'm so bad at spelling.
TrainSen	10000	 I haven't heard this, oh, yeah, it's by clay aiken, or maybe it isn't.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well.
TrainSen	10000	 Ozarka Natural Spring.
TrainSen	10000	 It was probably from Fort Worth, I'm from Denton about thirty miles north of Dallas.
TrainSen	10000	 I saw Jenny a couple days ago.
TrainSen	10000	 She's got curly hair.
TrainSen	10000	 Movie Night, um I don't know.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm supposed to by typing what I am thinking.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm talking with Victoria my roommate.
TrainSen	10000	 She is wearing a hat.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a hat just like it.
TrainSen	10000	 It's in my closet on top on a shelf.
TrainSen	10000	 Victoria is leaving now.
TrainSen	10000	 I shall say bye to her.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok, now that that is over.
TrainSen	10000	 I am going out to lunch with this girl from Christians on Campus.
TrainSen	10000	 Sounds like it would be fun.
TrainSen	10000	 Her name is Joselyn and she just graduated, I think from this college in Boston but she is here for just the semester.
TrainSen	10000	 Only 4 minutes have gone by.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, this is taking forever.
TrainSen	10000	 I have chemistry oops, mistake.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't like commercials on the radio, why couldn't they just play music commercial free.
TrainSen	10000	 My folder is blue.
TrainSen	10000	 I finished all my psychology reading (all of chapter three).
TrainSen	10000	 I learned way too much info on the nervous system.
TrainSen	10000	 It is going to take forever to study for the test.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm glad there is a lot of info in the chapter though, because I'm going to med school and will need that info.
TrainSen	10000	 I keep making typos probably because I'm typing too fast.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh, I have ice-cream in the freezer.
TrainSen	10000	 Mmmm.
TrainSen	10000	 It is a blue bell ice cream sandwich.
TrainSen	10000	 I like Wendy's.
TrainSen	10000	 Ah, yay, another commercial free hour of music.
TrainSen	10000	 YAY.
TrainSen	10000	 I like Avril Lavigne.
TrainSen	10000	 My Happy Ending is a good song.
TrainSen	10000	 Everyone criticizes her for not being ""punk enough.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  I laugh at how much time people spend criticizing artists.
TrainSen	10000	 They should just appreciate the music.
TrainSen	10000	 I think by saying that I was being a hypocrite because I was criticizing the people who criticize.
TrainSen	10000	 Does admitting that you are a hypocrite make you a hypocrite.
TrainSen	10000	 Deep, huh?  I'm wearing contacts.
TrainSen	10000	 I like my sunglasses.
TrainSen	10000	 They are on top of my head because it is pointless to wear contacts indoors.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, I am only have way done.
TrainSen	10000	 Hey, maybe that means I'm optimistic.
TrainSen	10000	 I am such a bad speller.
TrainSen	10000	 I spend way to much time thinking about school.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm such a nerd.
TrainSen	10000	 Everyone else goes out and parties and I stay in the dorm and study for hours and hours.
TrainSen	10000	 But I do tend to watch a lot of TV, wait, I haven't been watching much TV during this past week at UT.
TrainSen	10000	 Only about 1 hour per day.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm so proud of myself.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't believe that I haven't procrastinated this assignment.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't like this trend of girls wearing too short skirts.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I'm just too conservative and wear long jeans or caprice.
TrainSen	10000	 I bought new caprice.
TrainSen	10000	 My mom just washed them.
TrainSen	10000	 I went to the B.
TrainSen	10000	 E.
TrainSen	10000	 S.
TrainSen	10000	 T.
TrainSen	10000	 thing sponsored by the business school.
TrainSen	10000	 It was so much fun.
TrainSen	10000	 We went to the lake.
TrainSen	10000	 Hello, Jenny wrote me a note.
TrainSen	10000	 My printer is off.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't think of anything else to write about.
TrainSen	10000	 I was valedictorian, I was nervous when I said my speech.
TrainSen	10000	 YAY for 5.
TrainSen	10000	 0 GPA.
TrainSen	10000	 For having such a high GPA, you would think that I wouldn't be so scatterbrained.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it is just because it will take me a little while to get used to the whole college experience thing.
TrainSen	10000	 I have to sign up to do that psychology experiment.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to do the prescreening.
TrainSen	10000	 Victoria says that it takes two hours.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to get it over with and not procrastinate.
TrainSen	10000	 I have that awful habit and am trying to get rid of it.
TrainSen	10000	 I like this song, and that song, well, maybe not.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to go so sleep.
TrainSen	10000	 I went to sleep early last night 9:30.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh, this is that singer Chad Kroger (I am such a bad speller).
TrainSen	10000	 I liked Spiderman 2.
TrainSen	10000	 I have always been a fan of stuff like that: Spiderman, Batman, Superman, etc.
TrainSen	10000	 I like Smallville on the WB.
TrainSen	10000	 It is a good show.
TrainSen	10000	 What else.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't think of anything else.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok, I have about 3 and a half minutes left.
TrainSen	10000	 What else should I do.
TrainSen	10000	 I have chemistry in an hour but I should leave in 1/2 an hour because I want to get a good seat in class.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm so blind, even with my contacts.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't want to sit in the very front row because then I will strain my neck having to look straight up at the Professor.
TrainSen	10000	 I have Professor Laude.
TrainSen	10000	 He is very funny.
TrainSen	10000	 I went to a discussion session at 11.
TrainSen	10000	 Wait, it was at 10 and ended at 11AM.
TrainSen	10000	 I think is was fairly productive.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm a business major.
TrainSen	10000	 Did I mention that.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm also pre-med.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to be an pediatric ophthalmologist.
TrainSen	10000	 That is just a fancy term for a kid eye doctor.
TrainSen	10000	 It will be able to be cool to say that though.
TrainSen	10000	 My mom was a doctor.
TrainSen	10000	 My dad has a PhD, so he is in a sense a doctor.
TrainSen	10000	 He is asst.
TrainSen	10000	 Dean of the Business School at UNT.
TrainSen	10000	 I like this song.
TrainSen	10000	 It is by Maroon 5.
TrainSen	10000	 Nigel, my older brother, he is 23, I think, likes this song.
TrainSen	10000	 He has this CD and will never let me borrow it.
TrainSen	10000	Today has been a terrible day here in San Antonio, because it is all ugly and humid outside.
TrainSen	10000	 I am really glad that I came down this labor day weekend to see the family.
TrainSen	10000	 My uncle is very mean he needs to be a bit more nice to me.
TrainSen	10000	 He always makes fun of me ant telling me that I need to stay up in Austin and that I can't come down for the homecoming football game.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to move to another room where the air conditioner is not so loud.
TrainSen	10000	 I need time to think and be alone.
TrainSen	10000	 My sister really needs to turn the volume on the TV down while I still do my homework.
TrainSen	10000	 It is not fair that I am a very considerate person and then there are people who aren't towards me.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now I am listening to my country music while I am typing.
TrainSen	10000	 I find that country music soothes me and it very easy to understand.
TrainSen	10000	 This always runs through my head: Why does this Hispanic girl listen to country? I feel that this is what runs through peoples minds, it runs through my sisters mind, she likes to listen to rap, R&B, and ""party music"",  and I never ask her why she likes that type of music.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't mind that music either, but I prefer my country.
TrainSen	10000	 Another thought that crosses my mind is: how come this girl doesn't listen to tejano music? I ask myself if I am adopted in the family, because it takes me awhile to get something's, I have this hyper personality, and I have an ""Irish persons'"" chin.
TrainSen	10000	 I am smelling the fresh grapes that have just placed in front of my face.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a bad habit of smelling things.
TrainSen	10000	 I also have a bad habit of constantly washing my hands or using antibacterial hand sanitizer.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that I am obsessive compulsive in something's.
TrainSen	10000	 I always feel the need to be clean, and being organized.
TrainSen	10000	 It is quite funny how as I get older I need to be clean, but when I was younger, I didn't care if I got dirty, or if I didn't take a bath; I hated taking baths.
TrainSen	10000	 I am noticing that the time is running out on me and that I doesn't feel like it has been 20 minutes, it seems a lot faster.
TrainSen	10000	 I thought that UT was going to be a SUPER SCARY school, but it isn't because I have awesome classes and the environment here is awesome, everyone here is friendly.
TrainSen	00010	I just woke up a little bit ago and decided to go ahead and get this done.
TrainSen	00010	 I tried to sit down yesterday and do all my homework but when I got an offer to go shopping, I just couldn't resist.
TrainSen	00010	 My boyfriend's sister was in town and every time I go to Houston, she is really sweet with me and takes me out so I couldn't just let her sit at the apartment.
TrainSen	00010	 We went to the Arboretum and looked around.
TrainSen	00010	 Honestly, I don't have any money to be spending right now so I didn't buy anything but as soon as my check comes in, there are a few things that I have in mind.
TrainSen	00010	 This whole not working thing is really different for me.
TrainSen	00010	 For the past 4 years I've always been working and able to by my own stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 But now, my parents decided that school is more important and I should take 15 hours and just not work.
TrainSen	00010	 So at first the idea sounded really great but the more time passes the more I realize it's not going to work out.
TrainSen	00010	 My parents are giving me living money to go out to eat and to the movies and stuff but on top of that they pay for my apartment, all the bills, and school.
TrainSen	00010	 There's no way I would ever ask for more money, the money that I need for my friends and sisters birthday, plus my boyfriends birthday and Christmas.
TrainSen	00010	 Carlos' b-day is Dec.
TrainSen	00010	 12 which is not too far away from Christmas, so I wanted to sort of combine his presents.
TrainSen	00010	 In January some of my best friends and I always go skiing and this year it's going to be a bunch of us with our boyfriends!! So I was going to pay for half of Carlos' skiing trip as his Christmas present.
TrainSen	00010	 But now that my parents pay for everything for me, I can't ask them to send me on this trip plus another half of the cost for Carlos, I would just feel weird asking.
TrainSen	00010	 So I plan to tomorrow afternoon, after I get done with class, to go and apply to a few places here around Far West.
TrainSen	00010	 I really just want a few hours a week, something for a little extra money.
TrainSen	00010	 Hopefully I could work in a coffee shop, that would be ideal.
TrainSen	00010	 I thought about Starbucks which is literally 1 minute from my front door but what I'm afraid of is that they'll give me the early (like 5am) shift.
TrainSen	00010	 There is now way I can handle that on a Friday or Saturday morning.
TrainSen	00010	 So we'll see, hopefully I get something soon.
TrainSen	00010	 Ok well now what do I write? I have 5 more minutes left.
TrainSen	00010	 oh some good news.
TrainSen	00010	 My dad called me last night and gave me the great news that he won Incubus tickets!! My dad is so amazing when it comes to wining things on the radio.
TrainSen	00010	 He's won a car, trips to Cancun, London, Arizona, Seattle, New Mexico (all paid for trips of course), probably 100 tickets to Six Flags and Sea World separately, and so many concert tickets you wouldn't believe it.
TrainSen	00010	 He's just really good and always has about 4 radios going at the same time, all on different stations.
TrainSen	00010	 Ok well I just realized that I only have 1 minute left so I guess I'll wrap things up.
TrainSen	00010	 I do wan to say that I liked this assignment very much and that we should do all of the.
TrainSen	00010	 bye.
TrainSen	10000	A steam of cousiness paper is kind of a weird thing to do, but in a way simple.
TrainSen	10000	 At the moment all I can do is think about this paper and the impression I am going to make by putting down what I have to say.
TrainSen	10000	 Will I sound smart, dumb, or  am I completely doing the wrong thing.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well I guess there is not to much I can do about it now.
TrainSen	10000	 I almost waited until the last minute to do this and I was afraid that the system might be backed up or something, just like the prescreening survey.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow!!! I waited until the last minute to do that and I was sitting at me computer for just about 4 hours.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess that proves I procrastinate pretty often.
TrainSen	10000	 Sometimes when events like this happen I try to fix the problem and I do good for awhile.
TrainSen	10000	 For example I won't but things aside and and do things sooner than later, but after about a week, I am back to my old habits.
TrainSen	10000	 Today I actually got stuff accomplished, but then ageing I didn't because, here I am a couple of hours before this assignment is due, trying to complete it.
TrainSen	10000	 I am hoping that my internet connection won't crash or some other phenomenon, such as bad weather, won't affect me turning in this assignment.
TrainSen	10000	 Thing of bad weather made me thing of all the unfortunate events that have happened due to the hurricanes in the Florida area.
TrainSen	10000	 Bad weather, such as tornados, hurricanes, floods, is something that really frightens me.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it is really a big fear of mine.
TrainSen	10000	 When I hear that a tornado might be in the area, automatically, I thing the worst and am afraid for my life.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I just wouldn't want to go that way.
TrainSen	10000	 Although its not a popular way to die, like cancer or drunk driving, its just scary to thing about.
TrainSen	10000	 But after all the destruction in Florida there haven't been to many deaths reported, a lot more than there should have been.
TrainSen	10000	 This is a very serious topic and never thought it would take me to this.
TrainSen	10000	 I just hope the situation clears up soon and the areas recover as soon as possible.
TrainSen	10000	 Recovery can sometime be the hardest thing to cope with and get through and that goes with any kind of recovery.
TrainSen	10000	 Such as when you get in a wreck and have to recover from that or even recovery from a long night of partying and drinking.
TrainSen	10000	 That requires a different type of recovery.
TrainSen	00001	As I am writing this, the Red Sox are playing the A's.
TrainSen	00001	 I think this really may be  the year for the Sox.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope so because how cool would it be to see the ""Curse of  the Bambino"" broken.
TrainSen	00001	 Their lineup is killer this year, and they are finally playing  the game the way it's supposed to be played: defense and pitching.
TrainSen	00001	 They look like  the 1996-2001 Yankees.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm ready for a World Championship for my Sox.
TrainSen	00001	 I just read an email from home, from my Dad.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss him, just having someone  around to talk to.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I am really lucky to have the kind of bond with my dad  that I do, most guys don't.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean, not many people have  the kind of Dad who  taught them how to play sports and things like that, but I have vivid memories of  being 8 and 9 years old and my Dad throwing me passes in the parking lot at the  ferry.
TrainSen	00001	 With football season starting, I really realize how much I miss the game.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean,  it's been 6 years since I DIDN'T play football during the fall, and it is kind of hitting  hard.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss putting on the pads, taking the hits, the excitement of Friday Nights,  being the Captain.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss D a lot too.
TrainSen	00001	 we had such a crazy fall last year, always  know that we should be together but never being able to get it right.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss 8th  periods with her, driving around in my jeep and talking.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss Saturdays, the days  after games hanging out and eating hoagies, watching football with Micah.
TrainSen	00001	 I've  been gone 3 weeks, and I'm not homesick, I'm just kind of missing the Crew.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss  Meghan a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 For 4 years, she's been one of the biggest things in my life, and I  really think she is finally being able to grasp the fact that I am one of the biggest  things in her life too.
TrainSen	00001	 Which is good, because I really cannot see either of us  drifting away from the other.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope Andrew is doing ok.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm sure he is, such a small school is good for him.
TrainSen	00001	 He  really craves that small environment where he can stand out and garner attention  for being the ""Big Guy"", the built guy.
TrainSen	00001	 a school like this would be terrible for his  self-esteem.
TrainSen	00001	 But oh well, whatever floats your boat, right?  I really hope Micah does ok.
TrainSen	00001	 that kid has never been in a social group or circle  that I didn't bring him into.
TrainSen	00001	 He may really struggle with finding his niche at school.
TrainSen	00001	 I  hope not thought, he's my best friend and I need him to be self-confident and  happy so I can stop worrying about him.
TrainSen	00001	 I can never really tell if worrying about  people is a good thing or a waste of time.
TrainSen	00001	 I worry so much about Meghan, with her  mother walking out on her and everything.
TrainSen	00001	 and Meghan is so reclusive when it  comes to her emotions, even to me.
TrainSen	00001	 it betrays her every once in a while thought,  when I have a beautiful, crying girl in my arms, and it's almost satisfying to see a  basic human reaction/emotion out of her.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope D is doing ok.
TrainSen	00001	 being the only one of US not to go to college has to take it's  toll on her.
TrainSen	00001	 but from what she says, she is getting her act together.
TrainSen	00001	 I just couldn't  take seeing one of my best friends throw their life away on such a worthless guy  as Lee.
TrainSen	00001	 thank God she's finally going in the right direction.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I won't have to  live out that diner scene in my mind and deal with a haggard friend down the road  somewhere.
TrainSen	00001	 Of course, if it was going to be anyone who did, it would be me.
TrainSen	00001	 Going away has finally moved people to express themselves, and it really does  making me feel satisfied that I AM having an impact in someone's life.
TrainSen	00001	 or, a lot of  someone's.
TrainSen	00001	 I really don't mean that to sound arrogant, it's just that I invest so much  of myself into those people.
TrainSen	00001	 and I really believe it has paid off.
TrainSen	00001	 My family seems to being doing well.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm glad.
TrainSen	00001	 The girls will be back in school  soon, and next year Maggie will be in my position.
TrainSen	00001	 That's crazy.
TrainSen	00001	 Go Sox.
TrainSen	10000	Today was pretty rough.
TrainSen	10000	 My bio test was incredibly hard and I don't know yet what to think about that chemistry quiz I just took.
TrainSen	10000	 I've got this spot on the top of my foot that is rubbed raw from my cheap flipflops.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm really hungry.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if we'll go out to eat tonight or just go to the cafeteria.
TrainSen	10000	 I only have one class tomorrow, thank goodness.
TrainSen	10000	 I need a break from school but I find it hard to concentrate on work.
TrainSen	10000	 there's so much more to do around here.
TrainSen	10000	 my roommate is never around but I don't mind because my suitemates are awesome.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know what to put in this thing.
TrainSen	10000	 Tyler came to visit me for labor day.
TrainSen	10000	 we're not 'together' but we're still really good friends.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe sometime we will be but I don't want a serious relationship right now.
TrainSen	10000	 Esp.
TrainSen	10000	 not a long distance one.
TrainSen	10000	 Tulsa isn't THAT far.
TrainSen	10000	 But it's still a trek.
TrainSen	10000	 Esp.
TrainSen	10000	 since I don't have a car.
TrainSen	10000	 I have to get a 3.
TrainSen	10000	 8 to even consider getting into med school.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope that bio test didn't just screw me over.
TrainSen	10000	 everyone's like ""oh it's only your first semester"" but I don't have time to screw up.
TrainSen	10000	 my family doesn't accept failure.
TrainSen	10000	 my parents were both brilliant and so is my older brother.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess if I screw up it'll give the younger 5 kids a little breathing room.
TrainSen	10000	 give them an opportunity to be 'average' and not feel bad about it.
TrainSen	10000	 my main problem is procrastination.
TrainSen	10000	 notice how I'm writing this 'paper' the day before it's due? not to say that I haven't had a lot going on.
TrainSen	10000	 Because studying for that test was definitely important.
TrainSen	10000	 20 minutes is pretty long when you think about it.
TrainSen	10000	 I can be on the phone for 2 hours straight with no problem, but just typing for 5 is already killing me.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope psychology is one of my easier classes.
TrainSen	10000	 I took it because it interests me and I needed some sort of break from my math and science courses.
TrainSen	10000	 I've been really stressed and I eat junk all of the time.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I'll go running tonight.
TrainSen	10000	 but I've worn all of my Sophie shorts around the dorm so they're dirty.
TrainSen	10000	 And I haven't done laundry yet.
TrainSen	10000	 I've never done laundry before and it kind of freaks me out.
TrainSen	10000	 my mom has been a stay-at-home-mom my whole life so she did all of the little things.
TrainSen	10000	 pack my lunch, make after-school snacks, organize the family's schedule.
TrainSen	10000	 it was pretty rough trying to organize everything when all 7 of us kids lived at home.
TrainSen	10000	 But she always managed.
TrainSen	10000	 as I earlier stated, she's brilliant.
TrainSen	10000	 my dad works for shell.
TrainSen	10000	 not like at the gas station or anything but downtown Houston.
TrainSen	10000	 he does computer stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 And that's the extent of my knowledge about his job except that he's an IT manager and yeah.
TrainSen	10000	 veronica is making popcorn and it smells SO good.
TrainSen	10000	 my blinds are closed so they leave streaks of light across my keyboard and monitor.
TrainSen	10000	 It's annoying but peaceful at the same time.
TrainSen	10000	 I have road rage.
TrainSen	10000	 so I guess it's a good thing I don't drive around here.
TrainSen	10000	 too many pedestrians and bad drivers.
TrainSen	10000	 I'd probably get an ulcer or get shot for screaming at the wrong person.
TrainSen	10000	 I want ice-cream.
TrainSen	10000	 or pizza.
TrainSen	10000	 we had McDonalds yesterday.
TrainSen	10000	 Daron thinks their food is gross but I love it.
TrainSen	10000	 Sarah and Meghan were going to do dancing sometime.
TrainSen	10000	 I think this weekend?.
TrainSen	10000	 So that'll be fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I suck and dancing, but whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 who really care? there's a quote I like ""those who care aren't important and those who are important don't care"".
TrainSen	10000	 :) I love that.
TrainSen	10000	 my other favorite quote is ""a life of love will have some thorns but a life without love will have no roses.
TrainSen	10000	 "" that's helped me through relationships and crap- my sister Erica taught me that quote.
TrainSen	10000	 she's cute.
TrainSen	10000	 Looks just like me! ha just kidding.
TrainSen	10000	 she's a senior in high school and it would be awesome if she came to UT next year but she wants to go to a small east-coast college or to a Mormon one in the Utah Idaho region.
TrainSen	10000	 wherever she goes she'll be great.
TrainSen	10000	 my older brother, Bryant, is serving a church mission in Italy but he'll be back at UT in 2 years.
TrainSen	10000	 Kevin is probably one of the smarter of my brothers.
TrainSen	10000	 he's in high school and wants to be an architect (sp?).
TrainSen	10000	 then there's Kara.
TrainSen	10000	 she made the volleyball team (7th grade) and I'm so proud of her.
TrainSen	10000	 I tried out when I was her age and didn't make it.
TrainSen	10000	 Because I sucked.
TrainSen	10000	 And then I was too embarrassed to try out in 8th grade, which I regret.
TrainSen	10000	 Steven just started middle school.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm worried about him because he's such a little, sweet kid.
TrainSen	10000	 he's completely sarcastic and hilarious, but you have to get to know him or he doesn't talk much.
TrainSen	10000	 Shannon is the baby of the family and my mom said she's just like me.
TrainSen	10000	 ha-ha poor kid.
TrainSen	10000	 but she's loud and obnoxious and doesn't take crap from anyone.
TrainSen	10000	 she's funny and flirty and has all kinds of friends at school.
TrainSen	10000	 I used to be completely shy so I'm so proud of her for being the outgoing type.
TrainSen	10000	 she picks up crude phrases from me and the older kids in the house, though, and so that's no good.
TrainSen	10000	 I like my dorm.
TrainSen	10000	 some of my friends stay in these crappy small dingy places and I don't understand why they'd pay for that crap.
TrainSen	10000	 gross.
TrainSen	10000	 plus community bathrooms freak me out so I love sharing the toilet/shower with just one other person.
TrainSen	10000	 2 more minutes on this thing.
TrainSen	10000	 Gosh.
TrainSen	10000	 I bit off my nails the other day and so now they hurt.
TrainSen	10000	 Which doesn't help when I'm typing long papers for psychology.
TrainSen	10000	 do grammar and punctuation and sentence structure really matter for this assignment? I sure hope not.
TrainSen	10000	 I figure it's not English class and since I'm fairly good at keeping my grammar understandable, I should be fine.
TrainSen	10000	 10 seconds! that is all for now.
TrainSen	10000	 adieu (sp?) adieu.
TrainSen	10000	 Whatever.
TrainSen	00010	I really miss Desiree.
TrainSen	00010	 she is my best friend and it hard not being able to talk to her everyday seeing as how I don't have my cell phone here with me.
TrainSen	00010	 my not so intelligent sister was supposed to send it to me in the mail Saturday, but how much do you want to bet that she didn't send it until Monday and I wont get it until Thursday before I leave to go to Houston.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm drawing a blank.
TrainSen	00010	 how am I supposed to write for twenty minutes when I'm struggling to think of something to write after only two.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess I shouldn't think so hard, should I.
TrainSen	00010	 is that supposed to be a question mark? anyway.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm really enjoying this psychology class.
TrainSen	00010	 I thought that it might have been boring but as luck would have it Pennebaker is actually a really energetic professor.
TrainSen	00010	 I like that.
TrainSen	00010	 it almost seems as if he can relate to his students on a deeper level but at the same time he is still able to get his lesson across to us.
TrainSen	00010	 kind of reminds me of Brink, my science teacher in high school.
TrainSen	00010	 he has been there for quite some time now and he never ceases to amaze his students with his ability to connect with us.
TrainSen	00010	 I do not know one person in Cleveland High School or one person who came through CHS and had Brinkley that didn't like him or his approach to teaching.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss him.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss high school.
TrainSen	00010	 college life is really overwhelming at times.
TrainSen	00010	 Right now I'm pretty much struggling to stay in school and let me tell you that it is not easy.
TrainSen	00010	 I partied way too hard last semester and it would be a shame for me to go home and have to endure the horrible comments from everyone.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh nikki couldn't handle that big school.
TrainSen	00010	 She got the big head and got shot down as soon as she got there.
TrainSen	00010	 Look at little miss I'm smarter than you back in Cleveland.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess it was lonely up there on her high horse.
TrainSen	00010	 I have to be a success and that is why I have buckled down on my studies and reading this semester.
TrainSen	00010	 it is so important that I become somebody.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't stress that enough.
TrainSen	00010	 I refuse to go back home and end up on the same path that the rest of my family has chosen for themselves.
TrainSen	00010	 its not easy living up to others expectations when you know that you can do it but aren't sure if you know how or if you have the drive to do so.
TrainSen	00010	 My family is a bunch of nobodies and I hate to say that.
TrainSen	00010	 Well in an educational sense of the term.
TrainSen	00010	 None of them went off to school in order to better themselves.
TrainSen	00010	 but then again I can't really blame them for that.
TrainSen	00010	 I mean we really don't have the resources required to be true leaders or successes when coming from an educational stance.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm here on financial aid as it is.
TrainSen	00010	 its not easy walking in my shoes.
TrainSen	00010	 some people think I have it so easy but they really have not idea what kind of challenges I had to overcome to get here.
TrainSen	00010	 it was not an easy road to tow.
TrainSen	00010	 I been through it all and still have managed to survive only by the grace of God.
TrainSen	00010	 Speaking of God I miss TJ and Trinity and Tristan.
TrainSen	00010	 I only wish that I had more time with them before they left.
TrainSen	00010	 especially TJ.
TrainSen	00010	 He was and still is my baby.
TrainSen	00010	 I love him and miss him so much but his psycho parents took him away from me.
TrainSen	00010	 they could have left but why him.
TrainSen	00010	 I remember there being a time when he wouldn't even go to them when I first started working in the nursery and how he could only say no.
TrainSen	00010	 that was my little boy.
TrainSen	00010	 I love him and miss him like  you would never understand or maybe you would because I'm sure you have kids and even though he wasn't mine I loved him like he was.
TrainSen	00010	Today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what? It's only the 4th day of classes.
TrainSen	00010	 that's a horrible thing to think about.
TrainSen	00010	 I stepped off of the 7th floor elevator at Jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage.
TrainSen	00010	 It's awful.
TrainSen	00010	 I've been on some other floors and it doesn't smell like that.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if it's the carpet or something, but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it, so that's cool I guess.
TrainSen	00010	 I got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that.
TrainSen	00010	 yeah right.
TrainSen	00010	 This oatmeal cream pie is great, I'm so hungry because I haven't eaten all day yet, and all my professors successfully fried my brain.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate when I don't know everything.
TrainSen	00010	 well I don't mean everything because nobody knows everything, but more like.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate when I can't understand something right away, probably because I know that means I have to spend extra time learning it later on and that's never any fun.
TrainSen	00010	 I swear that when I used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger, so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something.
TrainSen	00010	 I wouldn't be surprised, or maybe now I'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself, instead of when I used to eat them years ago.
TrainSen	00010	 Who knows? or actually who cares.
TrainSen	00010	 Kate just called me and she's not going to eat until later, so guess that means I'm going to the chem.
TrainSen	00010	 review at 5.
TrainSen	00010	 It'll probably be really good for me so I shouldn't complain, but complaining is so fun, yet so annoying all at the same time.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't believe that I'm actually excited about going home this weekend, not for long, but I kind of feel like I'm missing out on so much in San Antonio, even though I'm not.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't wait to get some good Mexican food.
TrainSen	00010	 it's been too long.
TrainSen	00010	 What a horrible affect working at a Mexican restaurant all summer had on me.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00010	 The football game this weekend should be extremely awesome !! I'm so excited, my first UT football games as a STUDENT in the STUDENT section.
TrainSen	00010	 ha-ha.
TrainSen	00010	 and actually I think my 3rd or 4th game ever to see, how cool.
TrainSen	00010	 I saw something on Austin's news talking about ordering the games on PPV.
TrainSen	00010	 that's crazy.
TrainSen	00010	 I really hope that doesn't mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and I can't watch them.
TrainSen	00010	 like the away games for example.
TrainSen	00010	 That'd be so cool if I could get tickets to the OU game.
TrainSen	00010	 I hear that there's nothing like it, and I'm sure that's true.
TrainSen	00010	 but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 85 bucks.
TrainSen	00010	 and assuming that you get all that taken care of.
TrainSen	00010	 you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going, meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well, pretty crazy, but I guess if all else fails I can order ir PPV for 40 bucks.
TrainSen	00010	 yeah right, that game better be on ABC or something.
TrainSen	00010	 I actually called Kenny today, after my first Biology class.
TrainSen	00010	 he didn't answer, hopefully it was because he was in class.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why but for some reason I really feel like he doesn't like me the way he did before I went down to San Antonio this past weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 it's cool I guess.
TrainSen	00010	 since I'm here and he's there, but I don't know.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish that we wouldn't of met, so that I wouldn't have to deal with it.
TrainSen	00010	 But then again I don't wish that because he's a cool guy.
TrainSen	00010	 so much like me though, it's kind of scary.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish that I could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday, but then again.
TrainSen	00010	 if he did that I wouldn't like him, since it's all about the chase.
TrainSen	00010	 crazy how those things work out.
TrainSen	00010	 he's been exceptionally mean though.
TrainSen	00010	 well just yesterday, but like he says it's his way of flirting, but ha-ha whatever.
TrainSen	00010	 I like that boy.
TrainSen	00010	 dang I just admitted it.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't like him actually.
TrainSen	00010	 I just don't know.
TrainSen	00010	 I definitely don't think we're each others types though.
TrainSen	00010	 he belongs around a much more rowdy ""Karla"" type and he might just be a little too crazy for me.
TrainSen	00010	 Sounds like a challenge.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm pretty hungry for like some real food, I guess I'll go down to JCL in a little bit and find something, that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just didn't do it for me.
TrainSen	00010	 and I'm exceptionally tired too.
TrainSen	00010	 I ended up being 5 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning, and I don't think it even helped me that much since I barely got a B on the homework.
TrainSen	00010	 Man, I miss high school math classes.
TrainSen	00010	 Everything was definitely explained SO much better, so yeah needless to say I'm pretty freaked out about that, I'm actually freaked out about all my classes.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh well.
TrainSen	01000	Okay, I am writing this thing called stream of consciousness writing.
TrainSen	01000	 I find it hard to type right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know if I should follow proper grammar.
TrainSen	01000	 My Norton firewall just detected another blocked intrusion.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't like this.
TrainSen	01000	 Annoying hackers.
TrainSen	01000	 Why don't they just go one with their lives without bothering decent people like me.
TrainSen	01000	 I have 4 roommates and they are all good except for one.
TrainSen	01000	 He is nice and all but he does have annoying habits and it seems he does not know proper manners.
TrainSen	01000	 He watches TV loudly even though he knows people are trying to sleep.
TrainSen	01000	 He even woke me up listening to music using my own computer without asking my permission to use it.
TrainSen	01000	 That is so annoying and I can't stand it right now.
TrainSen	01000	 My goodness, it has only been 3 mins? I've been writing a lot of things already.
TrainSen	01000	 My arms are hurting because I can't type for so long and I hate typing.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not a typer, my brother and cousin are flawless typers but I am not.
TrainSen	01000	 I already had so many errors in typing right now it is so annoying me.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to destroy this key board.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to use the voice typing method but even that is a pathetic technology which is still in its infancy.
TrainSen	01000	 This is really annoying me.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to take the psych research right now but I can't because I am not 18 yet.
TrainSen	01000	 That is a load of bullshit if u ask me.
TrainSen	01000	 can't it be 17? What is your advantage to your peers in the same batch or class who are older than you by a few months?? A few months of extra knowledge??? I don't think so.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate my birthday, there is also a math midterm on my birthday, hooray for me.
TrainSen	01000	 how nice, what a nice birthday gift.
TrainSen	01000	 I have a tendency to measure how much I type.
TrainSen	01000	 I always limit myself and not going to much bec.
TrainSen	01000	 I always fear my efforts are being wasted or something and I am very lazy so I will rather do nothing or stop doing something if there is no punishment involved.
TrainSen	01000	 Like this writing assignment right now, if this was not graded or the lose of not doing this is very minimal, I will just stop and just receive the consequences rather than waste 20 minutes of my time doing nothing but write, senseless writing.
TrainSen	01000	 And I ate writing, I hate the damn typo errors, I hate now typing fluidly like others, I hate making mistakes, I hate typing because it hurts my hands and fingers! I hate this activity.
TrainSen	01000	 I am not in a very good mood right now, I kind of understand that, I wonder why? Is it my roommate? maybe, is it this senseless activity? maybe.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe its because University of Texas has cut my freaking internet, no I can't download beyond 8 gigs.
TrainSen	01000	 nooo bec.
TrainSen	01000	 u are taking up too much bandwidth and leaving none for the others.
TrainSen	01000	 What do I say? I say to hell with the others, what do they care if they don't really use the internet in the first place.
TrainSen	01000	 They are just wasting bandwidth on nothing.
TrainSen	01000	 This is just pathetic.
TrainSen	01000	 You guys are afraid of the recording companies, the RCAA or something like that.
TrainSen	01000	 That's what you are.
TrainSen	01000	 Afraid.
TrainSen	01000	 Why don't you just leave us alone like other schools? They have FREE internet, not this cheap limited ""u have to pay"" for internet.
TrainSen	01000	 I am just ranting away all my frustrations on this thing aren't I? I hope no one reads it, if u do.
TrainSen	01000	 the hell do I care! Damn it.
TrainSen	01000	 College life sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 To much reading.
TrainSen	01000	 Everyone expects you to read all the chapters and expect you to understand the next day during the lecture.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, tough luck, we are not that smart.
TrainSen	01000	 Some people do well in lectures and some do well with books.
TrainSen	01000	 Some people just can understand with the book so why do u pick on us?? Everything you test should be on your lectures.
TrainSen	01000	 The book is just for bringing your knowledge of the subject to a more concrete manner.
TrainSen	01000	 Lectures are what really is important, and you just read the book to review.
TrainSen	01000	 You don't test what u do not teach in lectures!! Thank God I only have a few more minutes left.
TrainSen	01000	 My fingers are burning now.
TrainSen	01000	 I cannot be stuck doing the same thing for prolonged periods of time.
TrainSen	01000	 It is just not right.
TrainSen	01000	 It is so boring.
TrainSen	01000	 Funny though.
TrainSen	01000	 if u come to think of it.
TrainSen	01000	 Ironic.
TrainSen	01000	 I cannot stand doing a same thing for so long but I can stand doing nothing for so long.
TrainSen	01000	 What kind of person am I? Indolent.
TrainSen	01000	 Lazy.
TrainSen	01000	 Pathetic.
TrainSen	01000	 That's what I am.
TrainSen	01000	 A person who does not want to leave his little protective sphere.
TrainSen	01000	 a controlled sphere.
TrainSen	01000	 I am afraid to do things with risks, I will never succeed in life like that.
TrainSen	01000	 Doomed not to be a leader.
TrainSen	00100	I am worried about my brother, Bobby, right now.
TrainSen	00100	 My mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the ER.
TrainSen	00100	 She said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now.
TrainSen	00100	 Tonight I went to church with my best friend, Amanda.
TrainSen	00100	 We sang a lot, which I love.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not necessarily the best singer, but I really enjoy it.
TrainSen	00100	 All the songs we sang tonight, I knew from my church at home in Plano.
TrainSen	00100	 That made me happy.
TrainSen	00100	 I also signed up for teams at church.
TrainSen	00100	 Right now I am a little frustrated though because Amanda and I are trying to do our Art History homework, but the website won't let me download the article I need.
TrainSen	00100	 Very Frustrating!!!  Oh, I need to go wash my dishes when I'm done with this.
TrainSen	00100	 Amanda and I made chili-cheese dogs.
TrainSen	00100	 They were great!!  My roommate, Sijia, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn't be walking around Austin alone in the dark.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for Friday on two pieces of music that I have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me.
TrainSen	00100	 I just found out about the assignment today.
TrainSen	00100	 School is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well.
TrainSen	00100	 All day I listened to one of the best songs I have heard in a long time called ""How Could I"".
TrainSen	00100	 The music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)'s voice is very soft and pretty.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper I have to write is about 20 pages long.
TrainSen	00100	 I didn't get much sleep last night because I was trying to read for Art History because I don't learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all.
TrainSen	00100	 I woke up early this morning to look over my math homework.
TrainSen	00100	 I won't get much sleep tonight either.
TrainSen	00100	 Amanda has music playing in the background right now, but I don't know who is singing.
TrainSen	00100	 I like the way it sounds though.
TrainSen	00100	 Tonight I taught Amanda how to tap dance.
TrainSen	00100	 It was interesting.
TrainSen	00100	 we went into my bathroom (because it's really big and has a good floor for tapping) and I taught her a few basics.
TrainSen	00100	 She and I have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so I am going to teach her.
TrainSen	00100	 She is going to teach me pointe, because I haven't done ballet in three years.
TrainSen	00100	 I have a bad knee, and last summer I had knee surgery, so I haven't been able to do very many classes the last few years.
TrainSen	00100	 I only took tap and jazz.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss ballet though.
TrainSen	00100	 Since I've moved to Austin, I've really missed dance because I don't have a dance studio here.
TrainSen	00100	 I would like to go take some classes, but I think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and I can just practice at home.
TrainSen	00100	 I bought new pointe shoes the other day.
TrainSen	00100	 We had to walk many many miles to get them.
TrainSen	00100	 Today in geology class, we played football and sang the UT fight song standing up with the ""hook 'them"" sign in the air.
TrainSen	00100	 It was a very interesting class.
TrainSen	00100	 right now I wonder if anyone has IMed me on AIM.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm really tired, but I won't be able to sleep tonight because I need to do school work.
TrainSen	00100	 My parents might go to the Bahamas in a few weeks, hopefully I may go as well.
TrainSen	00100	 I haven't been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy.
TrainSen	00100	 That reminds me, I miss my family in Virginia.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I can fly out there this summer.
TrainSen	00100	 That would be fun.
TrainSen	00100	 Virginia is beautiful.
TrainSen	00100	 The Chesapeake area especially.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me.
TrainSen	00100	 But he will be fine.
TrainSen	00100	 I cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (I have to do chores around the house because I live in a co-op).
TrainSen	00100	 Tomorrow I think I'm going to sleep in between classes.
TrainSen	00100	 I only have two discussion sections.
TrainSen	00100	our world is pretty fucked up.
TrainSen	00100	 I've been watching and reading the news lately, and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with.
TrainSen	00100	 well not the only thing, but almost the only thing.
TrainSen	00100	 the world has enough problems with natural disasters, why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves.
TrainSen	00100	 between hurricane Frances and soon to be hurricane Ivan, why do we need Chechen rebels, and radical terrorists, and radical governmental regimes to make things worse.
TrainSen	00100	 why is it that people can't seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right.
TrainSen	00100	 be it a Christian, a Muslim, or an atheist, every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong.
TrainSen	00100	 so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen, but also, others make excuses about it too?  ""they're religious.
TrainSen	00100	 they're unstable.
TrainSen	00100	 they're on medication.
TrainSen	00100	 they've had a hard life.
TrainSen	00100	 man fuck that.
TrainSen	00100	 people need to first take responsibility for their actions, and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what's wrong is wrong.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't understand this blur of morals and truth.
TrainSen	00100	 how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being doesn't know the difference between right and wrong?  I suppose I'll get off my soap box now, I just can't fathom the world getting worse, and yet I know that tomorrow, will be even just a little bit worse than today.
TrainSen	00100	 the only thing I can do is try and change my own actions, my own beliefs, and hopefully lead by example.
TrainSen	00100	 so I was just reading bush has tried cocaine, while bush senior was president.
TrainSen	00100	 ha.
TrainSen	00100	 that makes me laugh, I say more power to bush, he says he's clean, I believe him, I don't think his past should be this big of an issue, especially when he is running against john Kerry.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't even want to vote, but I feel its my duty.
TrainSen	00100	 so who am I going to vote for?  its like picking the lesser of two evils?  and which one is lesser of a SOB than the other one?  man I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 I suppose I'll vote for bush, being that this is Texas.
TrainSen	00100	 but I don't know if I'd feel right about that.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe I'll just write in a vote.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean I know all of Texas electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter?  maybe I'll run for president one day?  naw, I doubt it, I'm not moderate enough.
TrainSen	00100	 not that I'm a radical, just that I don't think I could say things to appease one person or another.
TrainSen	00100	 I have my beliefs and damn it, I'm sticking to 'them.
TrainSen	00100	 that doesn't mean I'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments, but I'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes, that's a fucked up way of doing business.
TrainSen	00100	 this feels good by the way.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me, they're very loud and annoying.
TrainSen	00100	 I kind of want to say something to them, but then again they're very large men, and, since I'm making snap judgments, they're probably alpha males who would want to fight me.
TrainSen	00100	 so I'll just let them be.
TrainSen	00100	 my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently.
TrainSen	00100	 they're a couple years older than me, and I'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her.
TrainSen	00100	 she dumped him because she didn't feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together.
TrainSen	00100	 I can understand and appreciate where she's coming from, but he was tore up about it.
TrainSen	00100	 anyway, they're here and talking about stuff, I can tell things are getting intense.
TrainSen	00100	 I didn't even know they were going to be here, and technically I was here first so I suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal.
TrainSen	00100	 she will probably start crying soon, and he will just shake his head because he doesn't know what to do.
TrainSen	00100	 man, I feel sorry for them both.
TrainSen	00100	 he just wants to love her, be there for her.
TrainSen	00100	 and she doesn't want to hurt him, but she has no choice, she isn't in the same place he is.
TrainSen	00100	 love is a funny thing.
TrainSen	00100	 love is a fucked up thing too.
TrainSen	00100	 I've only been in love once.
TrainSen	00100	 and I've fallen out of love once.
TrainSen	00100	 its a painful process.
TrainSen	00100	 but then again, I wouldn't replace it.
TrainSen	00100	 it was a profitable, great, shitty, learning experience, one that I can completely support.
TrainSen	00100	 so why is it that humans love?  or choose to love?  or choose not to love?  I'd like to be able to love someone again, that's a good feeling.
TrainSen	00100	 to be able to call someone and just talk to them.
TrainSen	00100	 see how their day was, what they've been up to, and to know that they wanted to talk to you, and ask you about those same things.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder what my wife will be like?  I wonder when I'll meet her.
TrainSen	00100	 my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married I think.
TrainSen	00100	 I may be wrong, but I doubt it.
TrainSen	00100	 I think they're both in a place where they're ready to commit for the long haul.
TrainSen	00100	 that's kind of scary.
TrainSen	00100	 hey, my brother is going to be married forever.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm going to have a sister in law.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe I'll be an aunt or uncle soon.
TrainSen	00100	 now that is really weird.
TrainSen	00100	 its crazy how time moves.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like graduation was a long time ago, but at the same time I feel like I still think and act like a 6th grader.
TrainSen	00100	 oh 6th grade, those were good days.
TrainSen	00100	 I thought I was the coolest kid in the world.
TrainSen	00100	 and at the time, I may have been right.
TrainSen	00100	 I was one cool 6th grader.
TrainSen	00100	 it rained today.
TrainSen	00100	 I love the rain, its so refreshing, so new, so clean, so pure.
TrainSen	00100	 it makes me appreciate the day that much more.
TrainSen	00100	 I've spent a total of almost 7 hours at this coffee shop today.
TrainSen	00100	 reading, writing, talking, thinking, listening, all things I can support 100% though, so it hasn't been a wasted day in the least.
TrainSen	00100	 I ate at freebirds today too, that was so good.
TrainSen	00100	 I'd say the feeling I have after I eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings I'll ever have to being completely content, lacking absolutely nothing in the world.
TrainSen	00100	 because when I've finished freebirds, I don't even desire love, because I am so full and content I don't need anything else.
TrainSen	00100	 its a good feeling.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm thinking about what I'm thinking about writing.
TrainSen	00100	 if that makes sense.
TrainSen	00100	 it is supposed to be stream of consciousness, and I'm working on that, but I think that I'm thinking too much about it.
TrainSen	00100	 I've had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point, now I'm thinking too hard about writing something.
TrainSen	00100	 its ok though, because I only have like 15 seconds left.
TrainSen	00001	o.
TrainSen	00001	 k, so now I'm writing for this assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm going to turn off the music I'm listening to.
TrainSen	00001	 ok, all finished with that.
TrainSen	00001	 it was bizarre love triangle by new order, I like new order.
TrainSen	00001	 I like order in general.
TrainSen	00001	 reminds me of the balance between chaos and order.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm probably more into that than most people I know.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if most people think about chaos and order.
TrainSen	00001	 the fan above me feels good, generating wind.
TrainSen	00001	 my neck has been hurting a little today because last night I ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night.
TrainSen	00001	 I totally busted my ass.
TrainSen	00001	 my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and I crashed sideways with bike still in between me.
TrainSen	00001	 gave me a few bad strawberries and I hit my head pretty damn hard.
TrainSen	00001	 for a split second my world was ""bamn"" and multicolor.
TrainSen	00001	 my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants.
TrainSen	00001	 this makes me comment on the fact that I still live at home, I still live at home.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but I'd like to have my own place.
TrainSen	00001	 but I don't have the money for that because I pay for my own tuition and books and expenses.
TrainSen	00001	 that sucks.
TrainSen	00001	 but I do feel good when I say that to other people, usually at work is when I do that.
TrainSen	00001	 I work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe.
TrainSen	00001	 I got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that I could work through college and not have to worry about loans.
TrainSen	00001	 loans blow.
TrainSen	00001	 there's the door again.
TrainSen	00001	 I keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text.
TrainSen	00001	 seven min, six seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 my dad just walked in and we had a ""how are you"" exchange.
TrainSen	00001	 things are going better with my parents and I.
TrainSen	00001	 there was a time before ut,(I'm a transfer from acc)where I didn't really care much about things.
TrainSen	00001	 probably because I wasn't being challenged, except from work which I enjoyed/enjoy.
TrainSen	00001	 anyway, I was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around.
TrainSen	00001	 the popular bob Marley type stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all.
TrainSen	00001	 although I wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero.
TrainSen	00001	 I stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right.
TrainSen	00001	 how interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 internet, seven thirty seven pm.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I was done now.
TrainSen	00001	 funny because I was looking forward to doing this, but I thought it would be more of a stop/start thought process.
TrainSen	00001	 it seems like I'm just narrating my last couple of days.
TrainSen	00001	 I was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable.
TrainSen	00001	 and I am somewhat.
TrainSen	00001	 wish I had my own place, privacy.
TrainSen	00001	 being alone is nice at times.
TrainSen	00001	 hmm, I have to write for an entire twenty minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this.
TrainSen	00001	 my face is all rough and ""treated"".
TrainSen	00001	 I have avg acne, not really the worst I've had.
TrainSen	00001	 I am using treatment though which helps.
TrainSen	00001	 my mom just went into the laundry room which I assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean.
TrainSen	00001	 because I told her that I would clean it last night because I went on a bike ride instead.
TrainSen	00001	 in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time.
TrainSen	00001	 but for some reason I like wasting time.
TrainSen	00001	 there she goes back into the laundry room.
TrainSen	00001	 and no comment, but no inspection either.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a good view from the office room where I am typing this twenty minute thing.
TrainSen	00001	 itching my eye felt good.
TrainSen	00001	 my right arm is getting annoyed at it's position.
TrainSen	00001	 now that I noticed that, I noticed I'm sore a bit all over my body, which made me think of going to Gregory gym and how I can't really yet because I am a gimp.
TrainSen	00001	 Not really though, I could easily tough it out, I'm competitive and athletic, or use to be.
TrainSen	00001	 sucks not being a true youth, in high school where you can dick around for four years.
TrainSen	00001	 I knew I'd miss high school for that reason.
TrainSen	00001	 I like when I repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other, like when I typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance.
TrainSen	00001	 I was so rudely interrupted by (a) the phone line for my dad ringing and (b) the twenty minute marker, which came faster than I had expected in the end.
TrainSen	00001	 ok, that was interesting, something I don't really want to do again, or do I? it was nice to get stuff out in writing, or typing.
TrainSen	00001	 ok, finished.
TrainSen	01000	Wow I can't believe I waited this long to write this paper.
TrainSen	01000	 I was in a shock when I found out that this was due tomorrow.
TrainSen	01000	 Deadlines motivate me more than ever.
TrainSen	01000	 I told myself that I was going to do this earlier or on some sleepless night but I guess getting it done is what is most important.
TrainSen	01000	 I just played some Starcraft with my roommate.
TrainSen	01000	 I used to play this game with all my friends from school before War Craft III came out for the computer.
TrainSen	01000	 This game ruined any chances for me to finish my homework.
TrainSen	01000	 I'd have to say this game was the devil.
TrainSen	01000	 It made my parents really mad when they would walk into my room and find me playing in the middle of the game.
TrainSen	01000	 I told them I would shut it off after that game but it was too addicting.
TrainSen	01000	 My parents somehow figured out that I started a new game and threatened to throw my computer out.
TrainSen	01000	 This wasn't a very good feeling.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, anyway, this girl from high school asked me to go to the homecoming dance with her less than 24 hours ago.
TrainSen	01000	 Somehow, all of my friends managed to find out in that amount of time.
TrainSen	01000	 This was extremely strange because I didn't tell anybody about this news.
TrainSen	01000	 I tried asking them where they heard this gossip but they refused to answer my questions.
TrainSen	01000	 This aggravated me just a little bit because my curiosity was at its peak.
TrainSen	01000	 A few friends from Houston already know.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean, what's the big deal.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't understand why gossip can travel so fast.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess it is because everyone wants to become involved in other people's lives.
TrainSen	01000	 I think this knowledge makes them feel superior to others.
TrainSen	01000	 I find myself talking on instant messenger and the opening statement would be ""what's up"".
TrainSen	01000	 The basis of a conversation is what is going on with the other person's life.
TrainSen	01000	 This type of conversation doesn't really achieve much but it makes you feel like you belong.
TrainSen	01000	 Figuring gossip about yourself is a strange thing.
TrainSen	01000	 You never know who's watching and points out the smallest detail to tell another person.
TrainSen	01000	 I figured my actions didn't speak THAT loud.
TrainSen	01000	 But any kind of gossip sparks a conversation like no other.
TrainSen	01000	 It immediately captures the center of attention.
TrainSen	01000	 I think people should be more concerned about figuring who they are.
TrainSen	01000	 This is not an easy task.
TrainSen	01000	 Starting college this year has sure caused a lot of changes.
TrainSen	01000	 Changes in friendship, responsibility and so on.
TrainSen	01000	 College is a good way of determining who your real friends are.
TrainSen	01000	 These are truly hard to find.
TrainSen	01000	 I knew this girl that had about 3 parties a year.
TrainSen	01000	 There would be over fifty people over at her house and she seemed to be enjoying their company.
TrainSen	01000	 But one time at lunch I saw her sitting by herself and she was by herself for a little while today too.
TrainSen	01000	 It's crazy how things can turn right around like that.
TrainSen	01000	 Well my hall is being pretty loud right now playing music or what not.
TrainSen	01000	 My friendship with existing friends have sure been tested and I think that the conversation we had strengthened our relationship.
TrainSen	01000	 We hardly ever talk about serious matters, so this was refreshing to me.
TrainSen	01000	 I hang out with a bunch of guys that aren't really open to their feelings.
TrainSen	01000	 We seem like a bunch where we tell each other everything but we know that we're just buddies.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean we'll be there for the other person in a heartbeat but no one really knows what the other is thinking, especially about relationships.
TrainSen	01000	 We'd always give one of the guys a hard time because we found out who he liked or what not.
TrainSen	01000	 I always thought that we would support them and tell them to do what he felt.
TrainSen	01000	 But this was never the case.
TrainSen	01000	 Three out of the four guys go to school here in Austin but the fourth person is in San Antonio.
TrainSen	01000	 I can tell he really misses the guys from high school and all of his gaming friends.
TrainSen	01000	 Everyone makes fun of him about his intelligence but I feel obliged to back him up.
TrainSen	01000	 I know it's all in fun but after a while I think it's just mean.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss the guy too.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope he makes it to Austin next year.
TrainSen	00010	I keep thinking about this White Stripes song and I cannot remember the name of it so I can download it.
TrainSen	00010	 It continues to anger me.
TrainSen	00010	 Its really dark in here so I should open the blinds, but I think right now there is a glare through a window and that would  not be good since my computer faces it.
TrainSen	00010	 Just a minute ago my keyboard was making me really mad.
TrainSen	00010	 It would freeze up and I couldn't type certain letters.
TrainSen	00010	 It made me so mad.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what Ben is doing right now.
TrainSen	00010	 He wasn't online but I know he doesn't have to work today so I am curious what he is doing.
TrainSen	00010	 I called him earlier today and then when I got out of school.
TrainSen	00010	 I really miss him and I am glad I get to go home next Friday.
TrainSen	00010	 I also miss my dog, Rosie.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if she thinks about me or maybe thinks I am dead or something.
TrainSen	00010	 Mom said she looked for me a little bit.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't believe my credit card got denied.
TrainSen	00010	 That makes me so mad since Mom sent the check like a week and a half ago.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if I can get on the website and look at my balance.
TrainSen	00010	 Dad is such a cheap guy.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't believe that he thinks I can live on $250 a month.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess I could but that would mean I couldn't buy everything I want and since Mom isn't here to take me shopping and buy stuff for me, I have to buy it for myself.
TrainSen	00010	 I just got back from Walgreens and I am also getting really mad  because my car is really dirtier every time I get in it.
TrainSen	00010	 There is bird crap all over it since it is under that tree.
TrainSen	00010	 I kind of like the spot and the shade, just not the crap.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder when I will start to feel better.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to take that medicine.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't stop coughing now and I couldn't in class either.
TrainSen	00010	 I bet it made the people around me hate me.
TrainSen	00010	 It feels weird to have already eaten dinner at 6:30.
TrainSen	00010	 It kind of sucks that they serve it from 5 to 6:30 because I am used to it at like 7:30.
TrainSen	00010	 The food here is not all that great but there is a better variety than Mom makes.
TrainSen	00010	 I am so excited about going home next weekend and sleeping in my double bed.
TrainSen	00010	 It is really hard to get used to sleeping in a twin when I usually sprawl out all over the double.
TrainSen	00010	 My bed also has that poofy thing that needs to flatten out because it makes it harder to sleep.
TrainSen	00010	 Bennett borrowed one of my scarves today and that also made me mad.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't mind that she borrowed it but I really wished she would have asked first.
TrainSen	00010	 Some of her clothes are really ugly I think.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know I guess that is what you get coming from Podunk, TX.
TrainSen	00010	 I like her a lot but I just feel like she thinks she is hot stuff and it also pisses me off that she rushed and I didn't.
TrainSen	00010	 I really would like to know how someone like her was accepted and I wasn't.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not saying that she is gross or anything.
TrainSen	00010	 I just think that I should have gotten into a good one also.
TrainSen	00010	 It makes me mad and disappointed and upset all at the same time simply because I always pictured myself being in a sorority and I never expected rush to go that way at all.
TrainSen	00010	 It kind of hurts even worse since everyone on my hall has all of the decorations and all of that stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 Claire also made me mad last night when she started eating all of my goldfish and stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 I have so much homework to do and all I want to do is go to sleep.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel awful because my nose is running and my throat and ears hurt, plus I keep coughing.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if it is just allergies or if I actually have a cold.
TrainSen	00010	 Mom said she would make an appointment with Dr.
TrainSen	00010	 Eldredge when I go home so that he can see me if I need him to.
TrainSen	00010	 I really like him a lot more than Dr.
TrainSen	00010	 Audrey because he isn't psycho and he is really young.
TrainSen	00010	 That makes me think of Paschal and Fort Worth because his office is down that way.
TrainSen	00010	 Man I really want to go to Ol South.
TrainSen	00010	 I really am kind of homesick.
TrainSen	00010	 I have been trying not to think about it because it makes me really sad.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I miss Rosie and Mom the most.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss Ben but I am beginning to think that we are not right for each other.
TrainSen	00010	 The other night when we went to those frat parties I was thinking that I don't know if I can do it or not.
TrainSen	00010	 I am not sure whether I am missing him or missing the attention and also I know that we are not really in love and I don't see myself loving him.
TrainSen	00010	 I really miss what Eric and I had and I think that is really the only relationship that I have been in where I was in love.
TrainSen	00010	 I think Eric is mad at me because I called him the other day and he never called me back.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if things would have ended up differently if he had gone to school or even had a better career path than he does.
TrainSen	00010	 I really miss him but I don't think I could do the long distance thing with him any better.
TrainSen	00010	 Plus, I know there were things wrong with him too.
TrainSen	00010	 I really wish I could combine the traits of both people I like and make a boyfriend specified to my desires.
TrainSen	00010	 I bet everyone does.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't believe how tired I am.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I could just go to bed right now.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe I will take some Tylenol PM.
TrainSen	00010	 Although that didn't help me at all last night.
TrainSen	00010	 Everyone is gone to their sorority meetings now so I think I am the only one here.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh well that's okay I will get a lot done.
TrainSen	00100	Right now I'm writing about the things I am thinking of.
TrainSen	00100	 I just got my hair cut and now I'm drinking a coke float.
TrainSen	00100	 which I probably shouldn't be due to the fact that freshmen 15 is a big thing these days.
TrainSen	00100	 my boyfriend just called and I like him a lot well actually love him to death, but sometimes I just wonder like if I'm doing the right thing.
TrainSen	00100	 actually I wonder too much instead of living life as it should be lived.
TrainSen	00100	 now my dad is wiping the back door off because we're having a party for my grandparents tomorrow - they will have been married for 50 years - that's a long time.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm glad that they're both still alive because a lot of people don't even get to meet their grandparents.
TrainSen	00100	 today I went and bought some clothes, which I probably should not have because I have a lot already.
TrainSen	00100	 this chick keeps getting on and off of aol which is really bugging me because little messages keep popping up saying she is doing this.
TrainSen	00100	 today we had a parade in my home town.
TrainSen	00100	 yeah I'm home again.
TrainSen	00100	 and it was cool.
TrainSen	00100	 Kyle is a senior.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish he was a longhorn because it would be so much easier to go to school together and see each other more often, but no he has to be an aggie.
TrainSen	00100	 today is the football game, I wonder if Texas will win.
TrainSen	00100	 LaGrange lost really bad last night - Hahira their not as good as they think they are.
TrainSen	00100	 mom is sleeping and she snores a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 dad keeps brushing the windows now and it is somewhat distracting.
TrainSen	00100	 coolcherrychick has just signed on.
TrainSen	00100	 cool.
TrainSen	00100	 lol wow my hair is really short.
TrainSen	00100	 man I can type faster than I thought I could, I guess that's good - hey it rhymes! omg stop with the window! I can't believe I found pants long enough for me at Bealls, that like never happens because I have really long legs, well not really but longer than normal.
TrainSen	00100	 now coolcherrychick has just signed off.
TrainSen	00100	 why do I like coke so much? I mean I don't drink it that often because I don't allow myself to, but I do enjoy it a lot - I guess the caffeine.
TrainSen	00100	 I have problems spelling.
TrainSen	00100	 this coke float is super good.
TrainSen	00100	 thank god he stopped.
TrainSen	00100	 ha-ha I just wrote stuffed before I erased it, anyway with the window.
TrainSen	00100	 my hair is really cute, at least I think so.
TrainSen	00100	 for once I'm not cold, its amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 rowing is going to be cool, even though it might be really hard, at least I will have a coach forcing me to work out and I can identify with a team.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if some people use really big words when trying to do this assignment, I mean I can use big words, but I really don't think in big words.
TrainSen	00100	 my cognate.
TrainSen	00100	 however you spell it process is not always so high smart or yeah that.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope rhea's oh regina's home, I hope rhea's reunion - that's it - is going good, I don't think she really tried very hard but I mean she hasn't been doing her best in the recent time on being responsible.
TrainSen	00100	 regina and laurie just got home and as I'm trying to think they are telling me about some kind of tattoo or something I don't know and I feel bad but I have to do this assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 oh well I hope they didn't think I was being rude.
TrainSen	00100	 this is kind of hard because I think so much faster than I type.
TrainSen	00100	 mija just ran with laurie.
TrainSen	00100	 she is so cute! sometimes she smells really bad though, but I guess I do to when I don't take a bath for awhile.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to see regina's hair because she got it done today too it looks really cute and it has red in it and blonde and I think she looks good with it.
TrainSen	00100	 Kevin called today and wants mom and dad, well everyone to put their money they're contributing for grandma and grangpa's thing in cash so they can give it to them in this game show thing.
TrainSen	00100	 the lady who did our hair is like 50 something but looks a lot younger.
TrainSen	00100	 like 35 or 40 - no lie.
TrainSen	00100	 well the television was just turned on and was talking about football now something is on about a comedian.
TrainSen	00100	 I like black people, they are so much fun to be around and they are not as uptight, well when it comes to their family I guess they are but not just in general.
TrainSen	00100	 I like jz he's cool but I don't know I think that I like all kinds of music, not any kind in particular.
TrainSen	00100	 sometimes I feel really left out because so many people know these alternative bands, but I don't because I don't really like the music as much as I like oh wow mija is getting a bath by laurie, yeah! other music like pop and rap.
TrainSen	00100	 It's amazing how fast this time is going by like I thought it would take a lot longer or seem like I was typing a lot longer.
TrainSen	00100	 I like that song and I can't believe a 14 year old sings it - jojo what kind of a name is that! I like the bangs I got cut, but I don't know if I am going to be able to fix it like this myself.
TrainSen	00100	 Kyle is coming over later and I hope he likes my hair.
TrainSen	00100	 and if he doesn't well it's not like I can do anything about it.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I was better at volleyball and could have done more with it.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean I can jump high, but I can't hit hard.
TrainSen	00100	 wow the gymnast was really short, but the volleyball player standing next to her she was so tall, I am glad I am tall, except when it comes to finding pants long enough wow I really have problems typing.
TrainSen	00100	 today I changed in the car, that was really not fun I should have planned it better.
TrainSen	00100	 oh well I guess no one saw and if they did then lucky them, just joking.
TrainSen	00100	 usa wow I'm really lucky to live here and have my own choices.
TrainSen	00100	 shampoo always smells good, well not always, but most of the time.
TrainSen	00100	 it would be so nice to be rich.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to read my psychology book and my biology book man both ologies, lol.
TrainSen	00100	 breathing is a good thing.
TrainSen	00100	 laurie can't reach the shampoo that's no fun.
TrainSen	00100	 my fingers are starting to get tired from typing so much.
TrainSen	10000	I am beginning to think I am committing to too many activities.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to be involved, but maybe I am doing too much-   I wish I did not have eight o'clock class on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
TrainSen	10000	 I hate having to get up early-   I need to buy my Chemistry book and Biology book still.
TrainSen	10000	 Books are so expensive-oh well-   I am excited for the football game this weekend!  It will be nice to have Monday off-   It smells like Lucky Charms-probably because I just ate some-   I need to get a transcript request from quad C to transfer my chem class from this summer to here-   I need to go by TOPS pics to look at pics from the other night-   I need to call my camper back-   I should do some reading for my classes tomorrow-   I am excited to do the SHINE program for the nursing school.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder who my professor that I get to help out will be.
TrainSen	00100	I'm feeling a little stressed right now.
TrainSen	00100	 I have two tests coming up in about a week and I'm kind of behind on my reading.
TrainSen	00100	 There is so much stuff to take care of now that I am out on my own.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes me miss my family; I'm feeling kind of homesick right now.
TrainSen	00100	 When I woke up this morning I found myself crying.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm having a little bit of trouble because this guy in a really intense e-mail told me how much he likes me.
TrainSen	00100	 It just happens to be my friend's brother so I'm worried about what I should do.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't really have anyone to talk to about it and I just wanted someone to comfort me and hug me.
TrainSen	00100	 But, I did talk to my friend today and he helped me out, I'm glad I had someone to talk to.
TrainSen	00100	     I'm thinking about going to a movie tonight with my section but I'm not sure because I think I need to stay and study.
TrainSen	00100	 But, I think I'm going to go anyway because I need a break and I need to feel more involved.
TrainSen	00100	 Hopefully some people will go.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder what I should wear.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to go shopping, I'm getting tired of always wearing the same things.
TrainSen	00100	 It kind of smells like spoiled milk in my room.
TrainSen	00100	 There are still boxes everywhere and I feel lazy for not getting rid of them, but I just don't feel like it.
TrainSen	00100	 I keep hearing door open in the hall, I wonder if my room mate is back.
TrainSen	00100	 It's kind of awkward with her here.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't really know what to say and she is not very talkative.
TrainSen	00100	 I still can't believe she told me to be quiet so rude like she did the other night.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00100	      I'm watching this movie on TV about a drill team and it makes me miss dancing.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean I know I'm still taking classes, but its just not the same, it's not as often.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes me feel out of shape, I hope that I don't gain a lot of weight because I'm not working out as much.
TrainSen	00100	 It felt so good to be back in class the other day.
TrainSen	00100	 I love the Modern class, it feels so good to be able to move again and that class makes me feel free.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess it's more laid back because the dancers aren't experienced and I'm one of the most experienced in the class.
TrainSen	00100	 That kind of makes me relax because I don't get as nervous as I do around all the good dancers in the other classes.
TrainSen	00100	 I get so nervous at auditions.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know how in the world I'm going to get into those major's dance classes.
TrainSen	00100	 Then what am I going to do?        My RA just knocked on my door to tell me that we are going to that movie.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel kind of stupid going because I've already been and my friends aren't going.
TrainSen	00100	 But, oh well, I guess that I will just go.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like I need to meet more people.
TrainSen	00100	 The only people I've have hung out with while I have been here are Rockport people.
TrainSen	00100	 I thought I was going to get away from all that, but I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what to write anymore.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm thinking to hard about this and I know I shouldn't be.
TrainSen	00100	 I should just type whatever it is that I am thinking.
TrainSen	00100	      The time is almost up.
TrainSen	00100	 It went by surprisingly fast and I kind of enjoyed doing it.
TrainSen	00100	 It actually made me feel a little better and sorted things out for me.
TrainSen	00100	 It's weird how writing can do that; Professor Pennebaker did mention that in my class.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess it really is true.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like I should have an ending to this.
TrainSen	00100	 But, I guess not.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess your thoughts never really end.
TrainSen	00100	 It kind of makes me nervous when I can't think of what to write.
TrainSen	00100	 What does that mean?  It's kind of like when I blank out talking to people which I seem to do a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm kind of interested in how this experiment thing will turn out.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder what the point of it is.
TrainSen	01000	I'm a little worried these past few days because of the work study award.
TrainSen	01000	 I know that I have a certain time limit to get a job and I'm trying to get a job but it's so hard.
TrainSen	01000	 It's even harder when you've never had a job experience before.
TrainSen	01000	 And my older sister keeps pestering me about getting a job.
TrainSen	01000	 I know what I need to do, she just needs to lay off of me sometimes.
TrainSen	01000	 That's one of the bad things about sharing a dorm room with a sister, she'll be able to spy on you and tell on our parents what's going on in my life.
TrainSen	01000	 It's not always bad because I don't do anything that will disappoint my parents.
TrainSen	01000	 The other thing that makes me a little mad is just because she is older than me, she can boss me around.
TrainSen	01000	 It's not like I'm her slave or anything; it's just that I don't like the feeling of being told what to do and when to do it.
TrainSen	01000	 I like being my own person, making my own decisions.
TrainSen	01000	 If only I had been able to do that since I was a kid so I wouldn't have so much problems now.
TrainSen	01000	 Ever since I could remember, my parents have always wanted me to become a doctor.
TrainSen	01000	 Any doctor is ok as long as I made it.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, what they want has followed me into my college life.
TrainSen	01000	 The only reason why I would want to become a doctor is because my parents insist on me being one.
TrainSen	01000	 So now I don't really know what I want to major in.
TrainSen	01000	 I had never been given the chance to really consider my career because it has always been what my parents want.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm just so obedient.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know why but I'm just like Ella in Ella Enchanted.
TrainSen	01000	 Always obeying what others says.
TrainSen	01000	 So, my college life has been ok so far.
TrainSen	01000	 I like the campus a lot and I also like Jester because it's in the center of everything that I need.
TrainSen	01000	 The PCL is across the street, and the gym is adjacent to it also.
TrainSen	01000	 The food is right down on the 2nd floor of Jester or downstairs at JCL.
TrainSen	01000	 Very convenient.
TrainSen	01000	 The only bad thing about it so far is that I have a TV and that means trouble.
TrainSen	01000	 I have become addicted to the show Three's Company.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to watch it everyday.
TrainSen	01000	 Let's see.
TrainSen	01000	 It comes on ch.
TrainSen	01000	 40 at 10-11pm, ch.
TrainSen	01000	 41 at 12-12:30am, ch.
TrainSen	01000	 49 at 1-2am.
TrainSen	01000	 So I stay up late just to watch my Three's Company.
TrainSen	01000	 I know it's very silly especially since on Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's I have a 8am class.
TrainSen	01000	 But somehow I manage to get up and not feel tired at all.
TrainSen	01000	 Amazing isn't it?  But it probably will wear off soon.
TrainSen	01000	 Another thing I have to mention, I am getting very tired of eating American food for every meal, I need something from my culture.
TrainSen	01000	 I need my rice!  So, I had a very wonderful Labor Day Weekend because I went to Houston to visit my new baby cousin, Jason.
TrainSen	01000	 He's 7 weeks old and o so adorable!!  And Jason's almost 2 year old brother is also cute.
TrainSen	01000	 Whenever we say anything to him all he says is 'I know' or 'I don't know' and laugh.
TrainSen	01000	 Just so adorable.
TrainSen	01000	 And when I had to leave, he was all sad.
TrainSen	01000	 When I picked up my bag, he took it from me and put it back on the floor so I won't leave.
TrainSen	01000	 I could talk forever about Jason and Jonathan.
TrainSen	01000	 But I didn't really like the Houston whether because it was raining the whole time so when we drove anywhere bugs would hit the window and front bumper.
TrainSen	01000	 So by the end of the trip, the front of the car was smothered with bug guts.
TrainSen	01000	 YUCK!  hehe =)  Oh no!  My time is almost up!  Well, I guess I can spend the remaining time saying my good byes.
TrainSen	01000	 Goodbye, chao.
TrainSen	01000	 Write to you laters.
TrainSen	01000	 Got only a few more seconds.
TrainSen	01000	 It has been good writing down my feelings, getting it all out of my system.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel lighter.
TrainSen	00100	So today has been one of the worst days ever.
TrainSen	00100	 I found out that I didn't do that great on my biology exam 1.
TrainSen	00100	 and I aldo didn't do that great on chemistry quiz 1.
TrainSen	00100	 I have been trying to do this prescreening survey for over two hours now and I am still not done with it.
TrainSen	00100	 I am hungry too.
TrainSen	00100	 I haven't had dinner tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 Well not yet.
TrainSen	00100	 so the prescreening system is really not working and it is making me mad now.
TrainSen	00100	 This is crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what to write.
TrainSen	00100	 Its hard to write for 20 minute.
TrainSen	00100	 it has only been 3 minute.
TrainSen	00100	 This is crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder how long I will get to use this computer.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh, I don't know if my class code is right or not, but I think that's what it is.
TrainSen	00100	 So we will see.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope This is the right one.
TrainSen	00100	 Who knows.
TrainSen	00100	 I have no idea what to write.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't even know what I am suppose to write.
TrainSen	00100	 I am really hungry.
TrainSen	00100	 Why wouldn't this Prescreening Survey thing work? This is very frustrating.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like crying now.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh gosh the thing worked and I want to get it over with but I can't stop writing.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I had started writing earlier.
TrainSen	00100	 I think what I just wrote didn't make any sense.
TrainSen	00100	 No I am pretty sure it didn't make any sense.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it doesn't matter.
TrainSen	00100	 I realized that u think faster then you type.
TrainSen	00100	 well at least I do.
TrainSen	00100	 May be because I type slow.
TrainSen	00100	 But who knows.
TrainSen	00100	 I think everyone thinks faster then they type.
TrainSen	00100	 Anyways, so I want to go finish the prescreening survey thing but I can't.
TrainSen	00100	 So I wonder what Liz is doing this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 I  have to study this weekend , because I am really behind.
TrainSen	00100	 I make a lot of typing error.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to improve my typing.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to go to JCL and eat.
TrainSen	00100	 Then again I don't want to go by myself.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if Kristi would come.
TrainSen	00100	 She probably would.
TrainSen	00100	 Liz needs to come get her book.
TrainSen	00100	 I kind of feel obligated, but I don't want to call.
TrainSen	00100	 It's her book and she should care for it.
TrainSen	00100	 She should call me.
TrainSen	00100	 Besides no one ever calls me other than Kristi.
TrainSen	00100	 Liz is a very nice  girl and I want to be good friend with her, but she  is always too busy with her high school friends.
TrainSen	00100	 They are nice too.
TrainSen	00100	 Why is it only 11 minute.
TrainSen	00100	 It needs to be 20 minute already.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder what Annette wrote for her writing assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 OK so this is not a great assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean its very simple.
TrainSen	00100	 It's very easy, but it is kind of annoying.
TrainSen	00100	 It's like talking to yourself, only you are writing to yourself.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean you are writing for the class.
TrainSen	00100	 Who knows.
TrainSen	00100	 this is getting old.
TrainSen	00100	 Actually if you don't think about the time it goes by pretty fast.
TrainSen	00100	 Ashley was telling me earlier today that she wrote about cookies.
TrainSen	00100	 Now that's crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 Well   now I am hungry again.
TrainSen	00100	 This is not great.
TrainSen	00100	 This is actually kind of annoying.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I wrote this line twice.
TrainSen	00100	 I am not sure.
TrainSen	00100	 Like the way I am not sure about my class code.
TrainSen	00100	 I know I am right but its kind of hard to agree with it.
TrainSen	00100	 Ok so I don't make any sense again.
TrainSen	00100	 See I am telling you , this assignment is kind of crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 I know he is not going to read this but what if he does? He is going to think I am idiot.
TrainSen	00100	 Why am I like this? I don't get it.
TrainSen	00100	 no I am really annoying.
TrainSen	00100	 I can tell.
TrainSen	00100	 but oh well.
TrainSen	00100	 I am who I am.
TrainSen	00100	 People should deal with it.
TrainSen	00100	 See now I don't make sense again I don't even know why I thought about those stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 and wrote it here.
TrainSen	00100	 I can go back and delete that , but that would be kind of cheating.
TrainSen	00100	 Except that there is nothing to cheat about.
TrainSen	00100	 You will be cheating yourself.
TrainSen	00100	 yay.
TrainSen	00100	 only two minutes left.
TrainSen	00100	 No it is true if you don't think about time it goes by really fast.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to stop chatting on the internet.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't even write a sentence properly.
TrainSen	00100	 Internet does no good to you.
TrainSen	00100	 well at least not to me.
TrainSen	00100	 Ok I guess this is it then.
TrainSen	00100	 only 30 sec left.
TrainSen	00100	 yay.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess I will need to find more to stuff to write about on the next one.
TrainSen	00100	 this is crazy.
TrainSen	01000	This is kind of weird.
TrainSen	01000	 I never set aside just some time for me to type and write and think.
TrainSen	01000	 It's crazy that my thoughts are not really coherent.
TrainSen	01000	 tiffany is typing next to me--her music is  loud and kind of weird.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not a big fan of rap.
TrainSen	01000	 wow look at how the font looks smaller after  you don't capitalize.
TrainSen	01000	 tiff's talking to me and going into the bathroom.
TrainSen	01000	 Stupid homework.
TrainSen	01000	 I am  typing but I don't know what I'm thinking about.
TrainSen	01000	 man it's so loud in our room.
TrainSen	01000	 she's yelling at  me.
TrainSen	01000	 she wants me to finish my work so I can talk to her.
TrainSen	01000	 silly girl.
TrainSen	01000	 the TV is kind of annoying I  want to turn it off but it's so far away.
TrainSen	01000	 college is making me lazy.
TrainSen	01000	 that reminds me of Dante's  inferno.
TrainSen	01000	 I can hear the wretch is that how you spell it? wrench clanking in the background.
TrainSen	01000	 tiffany is struggling to put our brand spanking new fluffy toilet seat onto the crappy and dirty  jester toilet that who knows how many people have urinated in gross!! I realize that even  though I am writing my thoughts down as I type, some of my thoughts are not being recorded  in this stream of consciousness writing because my mind is going crazy and I can think about a  billion things at once but I can't type it all fast enough.
TrainSen	01000	 stupid fingers! type faster! type faster!  this is such a crazy assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 I love how unstructured college is.
TrainSen	01000	 I love how you can do  whatever you want and no one gives a damn.
TrainSen	01000	 it's pretty spiffy! some girls is getting her face  redone for plastic surgery.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm glad I'm not heinously ugly or I'd be tempted to get some plastic  surgery done too.
TrainSen	01000	 crazy.
TrainSen	01000	 crazy reminds me of a song.
TrainSen	01000	 can't remember which.
TrainSen	01000	 man I kind of miss  high school.
TrainSen	01000	 those days of knowing everyone in all of your classes--- I'm sad that they are  over.
TrainSen	01000	 now I walk into class and I'm lucky if I know one person.
TrainSen	01000	 got to meet some friends.
TrainSen	01000	 but  Stuart is kind of holding me back.
TrainSen	01000	 I love him but I don't know if I can take his clingininess! he's  such a sweet guy but I wonder what it would be like to be single again.
TrainSen	01000	 wow look at how much  I've typed.
TrainSen	01000	 I love my new ibook.
TrainSen	01000	 it's so cute.
TrainSen	01000	 I just want to look at it all day.
TrainSen	01000	 how cute is it!  right.
TrainSen	01000	 dang I'm weird.
TrainSen	01000	 noises in the background are distracting me now.
TrainSen	01000	 too bad I can't reach  over real fast and turn off the stupid TV.
TrainSen	01000	 I really think that TV dumbs people down.
TrainSen	01000	 interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 my fingers look weird when I type.
TrainSen	01000	 they look like little spiders.
TrainSen	01000	 ha-ha.
TrainSen	01000	 website! that's the weirdest  word.
TrainSen	01000	 weird.
TrainSen	01000	 indweirdo.
TrainSen	01000	 too bad jaya and I aren't really friends anymore.
TrainSen	01000	 she's in psycho with  me though--maybe we can rekindle out old friendship.
TrainSen	01000	 Shelby was so mean to me.
TrainSen	01000	 oral interp  man-- at least I made some more friends.
TrainSen	01000	 don't need friends like that anyways.
TrainSen	01000	 JESUS!! LOVER  OF MY SOUL! JESUS! I WILL NEVER LET YOU GO!!! dang I wish that I could see Jesus now.
TrainSen	01000	 I know  that faith is what makes Him real to us, but wouldn't it be cool of they could make some Jesus  bears to hug when you're sad? I miss my parents a lot.
TrainSen	01000	 actually, I just miss my mom!! *sigh*.
TrainSen	01000	 it's  all good.
TrainSen	01000	 Frederick the printer.
TrainSen	01000	 ha-ha bio II.
TrainSen	01000	 such a good class to go to.
TrainSen	01000	 I love the learning, hate  the quizzes and tests.
TrainSen	01000	 high school was hard.
TrainSen	01000	 waking up early to study, staying up late to study.
TrainSen	01000	 bummer! and all to get into a college to repeat the cycle all over again.
TrainSen	01000	 man it's weird not to  have my parents around! why do people have rhinoplasties? they're so nasty!  ccccccccccccccrunk is what that is! tupac.
TrainSen	01000	 why do people die? I so do not even get it.
TrainSen	01000	 I think  about death in that it's scary.
TrainSen	01000	 I believe in Jesus, so will I definitely go to heaven? I'm such a  reasoning person that I wonder if there is a heaven sometimes.
TrainSen	01000	 but that's sin.
TrainSen	01000	 purgatory  according that Dante inferno website is where I'm going.
TrainSen	01000	 yay! will see the Son and the Father  one day.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to use the bathroom.
TrainSen	01000	 dangit.
TrainSen	01000	 still have 9 minutes left.
TrainSen	01000	 my hands are kind of  sweaty.
TrainSen	01000	 gross! man what a loser.
TrainSen	01000	 this girl is 16 on TV and wants a nose job to feel better about  herself.
TrainSen	01000	 that's so crazy.
TrainSen	01000	 why are people so low self-esteem? like ling.
TrainSen	01000	 dang that girl acts like  she's all that, but she has no self esteem at all! it's all an act, a facade.
TrainSen	01000	 yay! my battery is  charged up to 99%.
TrainSen	01000	 the % button is always above the 5.
TrainSen	01000	 weird, eh? eh? mission! that reminds me  of Monica and mission trips.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I had gone to Hong Kong with everyone this year.
TrainSen	01000	 I almost  feel like I let God down.
TrainSen	01000	 your love is amazing.
TrainSen	01000	 your love is amazing.
TrainSen	01000	 Your love is amazing to me.
TrainSen	01000	 my grammar and punctuation sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 man I wonder what she's doing.
TrainSen	01000	 haven't talked to that girl  in forever.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe I've been typing for almost 15 minutes! this is nuts.
TrainSen	01000	 ha-ha Michelle  from full house.
TrainSen	01000	 Chad Michael Murray is so hot.
TrainSen	01000	 gosh' can't believe he's marrying Sophia bush.
TrainSen	01000	 wonder what sofa and Sharon are doing at UTSA right now.
TrainSen	01000	 UTSA-- that's the root of all of  Stuart's problems.
TrainSen	01000	 that's why he's so clingy and insecure.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to help him.
TrainSen	01000	 but how? man  these apples are cute!!! the little apple logo makes me feel all warm and fuzzy! ahhhhhh the  door is not locked! tiff forgot to lock it.
TrainSen	01000	 got to lock it after I'm done with this thing.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm getting  tired now.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to watch love actually.
TrainSen	01000	 that's such a freaking' cute movie.
TrainSen	01000	 freaky Friday.
TrainSen	01000	 ha-ha  Lindsay lohan and her weird boobs.
TrainSen	01000	 no way can a teenage girl grow boobs that fast! why are  guys so obsessed with boobs? freaks me out.
TrainSen	01000	 anyways let's change the topic.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if dr.
TrainSen	01000	 Pennebaker or his TAs will read this.
TrainSen	01000	 poor people their eyes must be boggling out by now from  all the reading.
TrainSen	01000	 tiff is drumming on the toilet seat.
TrainSen	01000	 gross! she put my stuff on that dirty grout- stricken floor.
TrainSen	01000	 the time is going by freakishly fast.
TrainSen	01000	 dude it's already 17 minutes and counting.
TrainSen	01000	 I  kind of don't want to stop doing this.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe I'll keep an online diary just for myself to do this  everyday.
TrainSen	01000	 how do you know who you will marry? how do you know you won't get sick of them?  911.
TrainSen	01000	 scary day.
TrainSen	01000	 Stuart's birthday.
TrainSen	01000	 the phone is ringing.
TrainSen	01000	 the door opens.
TrainSen	01000	 flip flops are dirty.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel  like a loser sometimes.
TrainSen	01000	 but this is not a cry for help.
TrainSen	01000	 I love you JESUS! hahha I hope whoever  reads this doesn't think I'm a loser.
TrainSen	01000	 the little AIM man looks funny.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait to read this after  I'm done with everything.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to see what I was thinking.
TrainSen	01000	 Kim basinger and this dude are on  TV for this new movie.
TrainSen	01000	 who sometimes movies really scare me.
TrainSen	01000	 like Sarah Michelle Gellar in the  new movies.
TrainSen	01000	 tiff is wailing.
TrainSen	01000	 she forgot about a homework assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 uh-oh.
TrainSen	01000	 doesn't sound  good.
TrainSen	01000	 my tummy feels weird.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I'm getting fat.
TrainSen	00100	I have twenty minutes to write.
TrainSen	00100	 It feels weird that I'll be writing about anything that is going on in my head right now.
TrainSen	00100	 Looking at the keyboard.
TrainSen	00100	 It's a black keyboard.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm so hungry right now.
TrainSen	00100	 I haven't eaten anything today except a bottle of Nouriche and some cookies.
TrainSen	00100	 I'll be eating at Kinsolving after I'm done with this assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 Is that what I am thinking about right now? Eating? Actually, there is no thought in my mind right now.
TrainSen	00100	 Or it's just that I am too concentrated on thinking about this writing assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 What's the purpose of life? ha-ha.
TrainSen	00100	 I think about that a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 What really is the purpose of life? People all die.
TrainSen	00100	 Some people with their names left behind and some with no recognition in their lives whatsoever.
TrainSen	00100	 How am I going to be like? Which of those two will I become? My parents expect a lot from me.
TrainSen	00100	 It might be because I am the oldest child.
TrainSen	00100	 But it really does put a lot of pressure on my shoulders.
TrainSen	00100	 I know they love me a lot, too.
TrainSen	00100	 Ahhh.
TrainSen	00100	 What am I saying.
TrainSen	00100	 Love.
TrainSen	00100	 ?? What is 'true' love?? A guy falls in love with a girl.
TrainSen	00100	 And does all kinds of crazy things for her.
TrainSen	00100	 Then.
TrainSen	00100	 All of a sudden.
TrainSen	00100	 He falls OUT of love.
TrainSen	00100	 And starts looking for another girl to fall IN love with.
TrainSen	00100	 It doesn't make sense.
TrainSen	00100	 Nothing in the world makes sense.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to be an energetic, fun-loving person.
TrainSen	00100	 But I tend to take things seriously.
TrainSen	00100	 How can a person be fun? ha-ha.
TrainSen	00100	 I met a girl yesterday.
TrainSen	00100	 And she made us(my friends and I) laugh so hard.
TrainSen	00100	 The entire time she was with us.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I could be that kind of person, too.
TrainSen	00100	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00100	 Stream of thoughts.
TrainSen	00100	 What am I really thinking right now? ha-ha.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know again.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't think I'm really thinking at all.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm just concentrating on typing now.
TrainSen	00100	 NOT THINKING.
TrainSen	00100	 or am I? I am confused.
TrainSen	00100	 &.
TrainSen	00100	 &.
TrainSen	00100	 money.
TrainSen	00100	 I want LOTS and LOTS of money.
TrainSen	00100	 Money can buy everything.
TrainSen	00100	 Actually.
TrainSen	00100	 Every materialistic things.
TrainSen	00100	 I have 8 minutes left on the clock to write.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to go to New York.
TrainSen	00100	 That was really random.
TrainSen	00100	 Ha-ha Well.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to travel all around the world.
TrainSen	00100	 And taste their food.
TrainSen	00100	 happy thoughts.
TrainSen	00100	 Happy thoughts.
TrainSen	00100	 what are some happy thought.
TrainSen	00100	 ?? basking under the sun.
TrainSen	00100	 ?? No.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate getting tanned.
TrainSen	00100	 eating delicious foods.
TrainSen	00100	 ?? No.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate gaining weight.
TrainSen	00100	 Well.
TrainSen	00100	 But I do love eating.
TrainSen	00100	 Especially eating delicious foods.
TrainSen	00100	 but also very worried about gaining weight.
TrainSen	00100	 Vocabulary.
TrainSen	00100	 I had to memorize tons of them to prepare for SAT.
TrainSen	00100	 very random.
TrainSen	00100	 Why do people dream the way they dream? I have very weird dreams sometimes.
TrainSen	00100	 And whenever I do not feel well.
TrainSen	00100	 as in I feel lonely or sad.
TrainSen	00100	 I get really weird dreams that make me feel really really really weird.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate dreams that feel like reality.
TrainSen	00100	 I've had many dejavus.
TrainSen	00100	 4 minutes left on the clock.
TrainSen	00100	 I want this assignment to be over so fast.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what to write.
TrainSen	00100	 Well.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to write what I'm thinking, but I don't know what I'm thinking.
TrainSen	00100	 Houston.
TrainSen	00100	 Well.
TrainSen	00100	 Houston is a really hot and humid place.
TrainSen	00100	 Austin is hot and humid as well.
TrainSen	00100	 But Houston is really really worse.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I have allergies.
TrainSen	00100	 Hatred.
TrainSen	00100	 Is a strong word.
TrainSen	00100	 Hating someone is not good for the people who hate, either.
TrainSen	00100	 well.
TrainSen	00100	 Now 2 minutes left on the clock.
TrainSen	00100	 psychology seems very interesting.
TrainSen	00100	 psychology.
TrainSen	00100	 Study of people's minds.
TrainSen	00100	 how does my mind work? I want to try the lie detector thingy.
TrainSen	00100	 ha-ha.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to try it on other people to see if they lie or not.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm sitting up straight right now.
TrainSen	00100	 ENTIRE 20 minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 STREAM OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS I want a desktop.
TrainSen	10000	As I sat down to start typing, my mind became filled with questions about this writing assignment.
TrainSen	10000	 A lot of times, I will start writing sometimes for no apparent reason about how I feel and will end up on a totally different subject and sometimes I will even start talking about the songs I've heard and how past situations that have happened in relation to my feelings.
TrainSen	10000	 To be perfectly honest, I am thinking a lot about what my life once was like, all the good times, all the bad times, the lessons I've learned and through which ways I learned them.
TrainSen	10000	 I must say I am definitely a thinker, and someone who dwells on the past.
TrainSen	10000	 Today has been a rather unusual day for me because I am somewhat sad but also happy at the same time.
TrainSen	10000	 I really miss my ex-boyfriend, who was also at one time my best friend.
TrainSen	10000	 It's like I am missing a huge piece in my life.
TrainSen	10000	 I keep trying to figure out ways to go back in time, thinking what if, and if only I had done this differently.
TrainSen	10000	 The only conclusion I come to is that there was nothing I could have done or said differently, I guess the feelings just weren't there anymore and the basis of our at one time � great friendship was not built on a strong enough foundation to withstand tough obstacles set before us.
TrainSen	10000	 Yay, my favorite television show is on, well one of them anyways, 7th Heaven!  From watching that show, I become relaxed and more open-minded.
TrainSen	10000	 The lessons and values taught from it are in my thoughts, very useful in life and this day in time.
TrainSen	10000	 I could sit down and watch the shows episodes for days and not be bored because I like it so much.
TrainSen	10000	 However, watching this show makes me somewhat hungry but I know if I eat, I will get sick to my stomach.
TrainSen	10000	 Eating is a major thing to me, partly because I am very self-conscious about my weight.
TrainSen	10000	 Up until I got into high school, I never worried a whole lot about what I looked like or weighed, but freshman year hit me and I became paranoid.
TrainSen	10000	 I saw three doctors at a time back during my sophomore year in high school after getting Caught doing what I had been doing.
TrainSen	10000	 Of course my parents were disappointed, but they didn't get mad at me, they were just worried.
TrainSen	10000	 I saw a psychiatrist, a counselor and a Dietician.
TrainSen	10000	 The psychiatrist and the dietician are the people who made me have a strong disliking for doctors and people in the medical field, but my counselor, she was really nice and cool and pretty down to earth.
TrainSen	10000	 In fact, it was her that inspired me to want to become a psychologist; however, she does not know that.
TrainSen	10000	 I would really like to one day become a child psychologist.
TrainSen	10000	 I have always been interested in helping children.
TrainSen	10000	 Hmm, I do believe the chicken nuggets I am fixing in the oven smell so good.
TrainSen	10000	 I cannot wait for this weekend to come; I am going back home to see some friends and I think my friend Adam and I are going to a football game Friday night, and then Saturday night, I get to race, which I am pretty excited about.
TrainSen	10000	 We didn't get to race last weekend because it got rained out, which sucked, but I got to hang with my friend later that night, so it was okay.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, I just realized that I went from feeling down about missing my ex boyfriend/best friend to thinking about this weekend and the fun I had from the previous weekend, and I just remembered about my hand.
TrainSen	10000	 There is something wrong with it and I'm not sure what it is, but it hurts.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a bump on it and every time I move my wrist downward, something pops over it to the left and when I bring my wrist back up, that thing pops back over to the right.
TrainSen	10000	 It is really gross and hurts, but luckily, Friday, when I go back home I am going to the doctor to get it checked out.
TrainSen	10000	 It's crazy how your thoughts so quickly change and you don't even realize it.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, its been over twenty minutes already and it doesn't seem like I have typed very much.
TrainSen	00001	I am watching mtv cribs with Chris Pontius.
TrainSen	00001	 Today was hot and I'm supposed to go running with Nathan but it's still too hot so I want to go later.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I'll get some of my work done before then so I won't stay up so late like I have been lately.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm really tired so I took a nap today and slept like a rock.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know when I'm going to supper though because I don't want to eat before I work out or I'll feel sick so I might just get Nathan to cook for me tonight.
TrainSen	00001	 I am starting to miss everyone from back home because I'm not usually away from my family, friends, and Sam for this long.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I will just have to wait a couple more days to go home for labor day weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to go home to see everyone but I really don't want to go to the football game and that's what all of my friends are going to want to do.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm running out of things to think about because the TV is on and it's distracting me.
TrainSen	00001	 The song on this commercial is going to be in my head now for the rest of the day.
TrainSen	00001	 I like all my classes so far but I'm still kind of scared.
TrainSen	00001	 Especially about biology because my prof is going really quickly over the information and it's hard to stay up with him.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm getting tired looking at this computer screen.
TrainSen	00001	 my eyes are getting droopy but I can't get tired and go to sleep now because then I won't get anything done and I won't be able to sleep well tonight.
TrainSen	00001	 just like last night I couldn't fall asleep forever and then when I finally fell asleep I kept waking up so I felt like I didn't sleep at all.
TrainSen	00001	 my strawberry smoothie was really good just now.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm kind of hungry but lately I haven't felt that good so I don't feel like eating.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe ill just wait until later when my roommate wants to go so I'll have someone to sit with.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate going to the cafeteria without knowing someone because then I sit with people I don't know and we're always eating so we can't really talk with food in our mouth but I want to meet them and not be rude.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm sure they understand because here at hardin house all the girls are really sweet.
TrainSen	00001	 they are all in sororities though and me and my roommate Madison are they only 2% not in one.
TrainSen	00001	 oh well I have way too much school work and other stuff to do and I know if I would have rushed I wouldn't have time for anything else and I really need to do good this first semester and get it behind me and get used to everything.
TrainSen	00001	 My back has been hurting a lot lately because of an injury from track season but I can't get into a back specialist for a while so I kind of just have to live with it.
TrainSen	00001	 and I love to exercise but it hurts me for days afterwards.
TrainSen	00001	 I decided that I'm just going to start working out and if it hurts oh well because I really don't want to gain the freshman fifteen.
TrainSen	00001	 ha.
TrainSen	00001	 my boyfriend goes to school in Lubbock at Texas tech and it feels so different not being able to see each other everyday like we used to.
TrainSen	00001	 it seems like we fight every day no matter what and yesterday was our one year anniversary so I went and got him a present Saturday with my mom at the mall in san Antonio.
TrainSen	00001	 she wanted me to go back to Hondo with her just for the weekend because her and my dad missed me but I wanted to come back up here for the weekend and party with some of my friends.
TrainSen	00001	 my parents got to see my yesterday though.
TrainSen	00001	 they came up after lunch with my grandparents and they brought even more stuff for my dorm room.
TrainSen	00001	 my mom has been keeping herself busy at home by being creative and making cute things to decorate with but I really enjoy when she brings me stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 we went to eat at hula hut on lake Austin and it was really good like seafood/Mexican food.
TrainSen	00001	 I've never had a shrimp enchilada before then but it was great and my dad ordered an awesome dessert tray that we all shared and loved.
TrainSen	00001	 then we went out on the deck and watch all the people on the lake and just talked for a while.
TrainSen	00100	This past weekend I took a short journey back to my home city of San Antonio, Texas.
TrainSen	00100	 I went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell I'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm.
TrainSen	00100	 The dorm itself I like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that I can feel as though I am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent.
TrainSen	00100	 This semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do.
TrainSen	00100	 However, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that I got much accomplished.
TrainSen	00100	 I got much of my studying done and I finally got my book situation in order.
TrainSen	00100	 At first when I went to the Co-op I bought all these different books for each of the classes I am taking and then I came to discover that I didn't need about three of them.
TrainSen	00100	 So then I had to make time to go back and return the books that I no longer needed, and I had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me.
TrainSen	00100	 This weekend I also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but I still managed to have a great time.
TrainSen	00100	 I bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me.
TrainSen	00100	 The day after the game when I went back to San Antonio I got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old.
TrainSen	00100	 He is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make.
TrainSen	00100	 I was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but I will see him every now and then when I get a chance to journey back home.
TrainSen	00100	 I also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years.
TrainSen	00100	 We went out to eat and to see a movie.
TrainSen	00100	 We weren't sure what movie to see so I thought I would let her pick because of the nice that I am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street.
TrainSen	00100	 He immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted.
TrainSen	00100	 In the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait for winter time.
TrainSen	00100	 It is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and I go skiing in Colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there.
TrainSen	00100	 One of the worst times I've ever had there is when I wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and I jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and I smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion.
TrainSen	00100	 All together I would have to say that I'm very excited about this year, and I can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life.
TrainSen	00010	Working out is stressful.
TrainSen	00010	 Especially if all I do is arms.
TrainSen	00010	 Man I am tired.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I could have a protein shake or supplement right now to be able to maximize my workout.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to go to the bathroom but I can't since I have to right this.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm glad that I finished the reading assignment over the weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh my arms are so heavy! I like working out but sometimes it takes a toll.
TrainSen	00010	 My biceps are bulging and pulsing.
TrainSen	00010	 Man I wish I could play a game right now.
TrainSen	00010	 And now I have gone blank a little.
TrainSen	00010	 Its tough to do this.
TrainSen	00010	 To think about what one is thinking.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to move my mouse.
TrainSen	00010	 There we go.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I need an arm pad or an extension to my desk.
TrainSen	00010	 Man I wish I could rationally think sometimes.
TrainSen	00010	 Or maybe I do.
TrainSen	00010	 I really need to extend this desk.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I'm reaching way too far out but my arms are so dead that it kind of feels good.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow, now I'm getting thirsty, but its probably because I just got done working out.
TrainSen	00010	 It says it is 76 degrees outside.
TrainSen	00010	 Let me actually check.
TrainSen	00010	 It is.
TrainSen	00010	 A shake would taste good right about now.
TrainSen	00010	 Jester 2nd floor was good today, but not like I had expected it.
TrainSen	00010	 A lot cheaper though.
TrainSen	00010	 Its weird how they charge more if you use a different form of payment than Dine in dollars.
TrainSen	00010	 I've always wondered why lunch is cheaper than dinner.
TrainSen	00010	 I usually eat as much or sometimes more at lunch than dinner.
TrainSen	00010	 So I wonder why most restaurants charge more for dinner.
TrainSen	00010	 It probably is the belief that people eat more at dinner, or maybe they are trying to pull in crowds at lunchtime because they are not as busy then.
TrainSen	00010	 Who knows and honestly who cares.
TrainSen	00010	 The room next door to us has a very squeaky door.
TrainSen	00010	 It slams hard.
TrainSen	00010	 Ouch my deltoid.
TrainSen	00010	 I am hungry, or maybe thirsty.
TrainSen	00010	 I really can't decide right now.
TrainSen	00010	 Ouch! Wow 11 more minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 This has kind of gone by fast.
TrainSen	00010	 I thought it would take forever but it is an okay assignment.
TrainSen	00010	 And I'm so glad I did my readings the weekend before.
TrainSen	00010	 It allowed me to have more fun time for me and time to do this assignment.
TrainSen	00010	 Those 30 seconds went by fast.
TrainSen	00010	 The people are always going in and out or maybe that's just what it sounds like to me.
TrainSen	00010	 Up till like even 2 am in the morning I can always hear people outside my window.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder why they are up so late outside.
TrainSen	00010	 Usually people up that late are either studying or getting drunk out of their mind.
TrainSen	00010	 Well I'm going to get something to drink right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I have had the grape flavor yet so I'm going to see what that's like.
TrainSen	00010	 Never mind, my roommate and his friend took the refrigerated one.
TrainSen	00010	 Going over to get more to cool down even showed me more how I was sore, or maybe just tired.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I have a coke though.
TrainSen	00010	 But I need to fill my food void.
TrainSen	00010	 Some applesauce would be nice.
TrainSen	00010	 But I do love sour punch straws.
TrainSen	00010	 Mmmmm.
TrainSen	00010	 They are so good.
TrainSen	00010	 Nah ill have applesauce.
TrainSen	00010	 There are also some grapes too.
TrainSen	00010	 Green grapes! My favorite.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why but I've never liked red ones or purple.
TrainSen	00010	 WITHe they call it.
TrainSen	00010	 My favorite color was purple because I loved the grape flavor so much.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I've changed my ways because I've learned that purple is a feminine color.
TrainSen	00010	 Now to get some applesauce.
TrainSen	00010	 I have to have 2 at a time or its not enough.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm a klutz.
TrainSen	00010	 I always drop things or trip at the worst times, but then most people don't trip when they want to.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why but I've been wanting to get fatter.
TrainSen	00010	 Or at least gain wait for a long time now, but I need to eat healthy because I have high cholesterol.
TrainSen	00010	 I always wanted to gain weight because of football, now I just say it because I always have.
TrainSen	00010	 When buying this applesauce it was most economical and accessible.
TrainSen	00010	 They are 4oz each.
TrainSen	00010	 It says that each cup is one fruit serving of an apple, or just one apple.
TrainSen	00010	 Yes! 1 minute! This applesauce is a little watery.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate when ketchup comes out at first and its has a watery mix to it.
TrainSen	00010	 That really disgusts me when at first ketchup isn't my favorite thing to eat.
TrainSen	01000	Wow, so here I go.
TrainSen	01000	 This is actually pretty exciting, I don't think I have ever had such a fun writing assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 Jessica's music is on, her music was playing at the same time as mine, hers was rap, mine was ""honey and the moon"", weird combination.
TrainSen	01000	 she's still listening to it.
TrainSen	01000	 I have an aftertaste of godiva chocolate in my mouth, my sister sent me my shirt I forgot.
TrainSen	01000	 and I was just at drews, across the hall.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how I did on my bio exam.
TrainSen	01000	 We get the grades back today in our review session.
TrainSen	01000	 It was stressful but I think I did ok.
TrainSen	01000	 We'll see I guess.
TrainSen	01000	 My sheets are bright I wonder what everyone is doing at home right now.
TrainSen	01000	 Let's see.
TrainSen	01000	 its almost 3, so everyone's working.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss Jude, he's so cute and now that I'm here I'm going to miss out on him taking his first steps, him first talking, etc.
TrainSen	01000	 But it was fun watching him grow.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss him the most.
TrainSen	01000	 It'll be nice to be home next weekend, I want to lay out in the sun by my pool, with my dogs.
TrainSen	01000	 Tonight's going to be busy, with me catching up in all my classes and all.
TrainSen	01000	 But what I really want to do is see Drew, because I like hanging out with him.
TrainSen	01000	 But then once I get back into my room, and I shut the door, that's when reality sets in, and that's when I realize that I have to stay with Scott because he needs me right now.
TrainSen	01000	 And it wouldn't be fair after all of this.
TrainSen	01000	 This writing assignment is pretty crazy, I still have awhile to go.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe I just don't have enough to write about? Let me think here.
TrainSen	01000	 I find myself staring into my panoramic photo of a sunrise on the beach in Hawaii.
TrainSen	01000	 It's a pretty tight picture, and I wish I could just be back there right now, instead of stressing here at school.
TrainSen	01000	 Even though this experience is pretty awesome.
TrainSen	01000	 I still find myself stressing more than the ordinary college student.
TrainSen	01000	 My insecurities keep building up , until something or someone comes along and then I'll let them fall down.
TrainSen	01000	 One of my goals is to be able to walk around with my head raised high up, chin up, smiling, confident.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I could be that person, but for some reason I guess I feel too uneasy about my appearances.
TrainSen	01000	 Most likely, that is the result of going to a school with really judgmental people.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh well, it'll just be something I need to grow out of here.
TrainSen	01000	 That's one thing that I love about UT, no one really cares what you look like, talk like, etc.
TrainSen	01000	 It's a nice change.
TrainSen	01000	 Last night I had another crazy dream, I want to start writing them down but sometimes I just can't remember them.
TrainSen	01000	 Like last night, some guys broke into my house, and they were chasing us out.
TrainSen	01000	 But I somehow convinced them with my kindness or something (as I do in many of my dreams that are very similar to this) that they should leave us alone.
TrainSen	01000	 I just remember showing them my ""mastiff"" dog.
TrainSen	01000	 Ok, is that even a dog, or did I make that up or what.
TrainSen	01000	 Whoa, a crazy thing that came across my mind yesterday was this thought (I was actually thinking about it yesterday in psychology class): ""They say that color is the result of light being absorbed or reflected off of an object.
TrainSen	01000	 So in order to see color, there has to be light, right?  If that is true, then is it true whenever you go into a pitch black room, everything is actually without color?! I know that everything wouldn't be in black and white, but wouldn't everything be in black at least?! Everyone would be of the same color in a dark room? It's pretty mind baffling to me.
TrainSen	01000	 "" Also, I've heard that whenever you dream, you don't really dream in color, but your mind and memory make up the colors.
TrainSen	01000	 They are not true colors.
TrainSen	01000	 Who really knows anyways? The zipper of my Dior makeup bag is dipping into the cap of my orange juice bottle that I had this morning.
TrainSen	01000	 Last night was all fun and games until I got home and realized how unsure I am of everything right now, and it's really not a good feeling.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I'm just getting used to this whole thing, just transitioning.
TrainSen	01000	 Jess forgot to get milk last night, so I had dry cereal this morning.
TrainSen	01000	 There is still some left in my bowl right here, I was too busy rushing around, trying to meet Scott in time for chemistry.
TrainSen	00010	Stream of Consciousness that term reminds me so much of Virginia Woolf and my long semester studying her and Mrs.
TrainSen	00010	 Dalloway.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't even think about it without thinking of her and her crazy life and the craziness with how Mrs.
TrainSen	00010	 Dalloway was written and it makes me so sad because her life was just so sad.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel so bad for her.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder how fast twenty minutes really is I bet it may end up seeming forever and this writing will go on forever but I guess it is kind of interesting I just am worried my hands will begin to hurt from all of this typing.
TrainSen	00010	 I am so glad that it is Labor Day weekend and I am going to get a long weekend to catch up on a few things like sleep and fun and I guess some studying too although that won't be too fun so that will actually take away from some of the fun goal.
TrainSen	00010	 it is so interesting how I am sitting here all alone in my room and in fact most of the time it gets kind of lonely but sitting her and I some way expressing my thoughts instead of just listening to them and doing nothing makes it not so lonely and for once it is actually quiet in the dorm so that I can concentrate on just about anything.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope this year goes well because I think that it really needs to be a good semester and that it will progress to a good year I if The semester goes well.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm getting kind of sad now that because I am leaving town tomorrow I am going to miss the first Football which will be my first Texas football game and I have heard they are a great experience and a ton of fun, but at least there are plenty of other games that I can attend.
TrainSen	00010	 My hand is really beginning to hurt that is really pretty sad considering I haven't even typed for 10 minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if I am missing out on anything while I am sitting her typing this but I guess it isn't that big of a deal I don't think there are many people her anyway and I don't know where anyone is.
TrainSen	00010	 I was thinking about how when I graduated from high school that I would be balling my eyes out but I didn't cry then I thought I would cry when My parents left me here all alone.
TrainSen	00010	 but the weird thing is I haven't cried or anything yet I haven't even gotten homesick.
TrainSen	00010	 I mean let's face it isn't like I would have anything spectacular to do even if I was home so I guess that helps in the homesickness department.
TrainSen	00010	 It is so cold in my room I am absolutely freezing and There is no way in which to control the air, I need gloves and winter boots.
TrainSen	00010	 I really think that people need to something about the coolness of the buildings I mean I know it is hot outside and all but because it is hot outside students want to wear shorts and other things like that to keep cool when out in the heat, but then you step in a building and dorms are the absolute worst of all and you freeze to death like I am surprised I haven't gotten frost bite from these frigid places.
TrainSen	00010	 Well the time has actually gone faster than I expected it to it hasn't been all that bad once I got over the whole Virginia Woolf suicide and her book that I had to suffer through and analyze.
TrainSen	00010	 It has actually been kind of fun I mean all I have been doing is saying what is on my mind and how I am feeling and that isn't so hard as long as you know that not everyone in the world is going to be reading what you write because personally I Don't' want everyone in the world to know how I feel all the time it is pretty personal for the most part.
TrainSen	00010	 I am really excited about getting to hang out at the lake this weekend and being able to relax and have food other than from the cafeteria not that the food is all that bad but a homecooked meal is the absolute best.
TrainSen	00010	 that is real comfort food.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow I am beginning to feel hungry now but I don't know for what also I really need these twenty minutes to over so that I can run and go get a drink I am really thirsty.
TrainSen	00010	 oh my gosh my hands are like icicles between the pain from typing and the temperature of the room my hands are really beginning to suffer.
TrainSen	00010	 but hey I don't have to type for too much longer.
TrainSen	00001	Being a twin I always wonder if my brother thinks like I do.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't mean like does he have the same thought I mean does he see the world in the same perspective as me.
TrainSen	00001	 My mind like to wander and I imagine many different scenarios in my head.
TrainSen	00001	 Like where I will be in 20 years how long I will live and why people act the way they do.
TrainSen	00001	 Everyday I think of the things why people seem to not want to try and others try there hardest.
TrainSen	00001	 Then you have people who succeed no matter what and I wonder why them.
TrainSen	00001	 Then there are people who seem to go no where in life.
TrainSen	00001	 I am not seriously making this up for the past year or so I have been trying to figure out the world.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess since I have left home many things in my life have changed some for the good and others just different from my life at home.
TrainSen	00001	 I also wonder in my head a lot are we all determined to do a specific job or career.
TrainSen	00001	 I felt at one time I was determined to be an astronaut, but now I am leaning towards the media business.
TrainSen	00001	 I would like to make a movie that answers many questions that people are struggling with mainly people that are going through changes in the life.
TrainSen	00001	 Although change is not necessarily it creates a sense in my mind at least that this could either be a bad  and good experience.
TrainSen	00001	 I am talking about me coming to college.
TrainSen	00001	 If this writing seems to be changing topics a lot then that is probably because that is how I think I continuously switching ideas in my mind.
TrainSen	00001	 It is a wonder of why I have some of the thoughts I have, but we wont go into that.
TrainSen	00001	 Being my first to take Psychology I wonder what the class is going to offer me, how it will help me to explore the human mind.
TrainSen	00001	 I have also noticed that while being at college my sleep patterns have changed I stay up late get up early sleep on the weekends.
TrainSen	00001	 Since being here I have started some sort of routine as far as my day goes, but I often wonder why us as people have routine and if they are inevitably unavoidable.
TrainSen	00001	 This summer I worked in a grocery store was it fun no not really but it gave me a perspective of how I should view the world.
TrainSen	00001	 There would be weeks when I got up at before 5:00 am everyday I kind of got this feeling like is this what I will be doing for the rest of my life.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought to myself therefore I will do good in college to help better the career.
TrainSen	00001	 Working forty hours a week and making about three hundred dollars I wondered a lot of times how some one lived on that and I guess they do somehow.
TrainSen	00001	 That is why it kind of bothers me that we have some of these people blaming the economy on one person when I believe there is an overall problem in certain area.
TrainSen	00001	 But are we certain at all what goes on.
TrainSen	00010	Hey what's up? I just got home from school and hopefully I can finish doing this before my sister gets home and takes over the computer.
TrainSen	00010	 Today was cool I got my hair cut finally and the girl that did it was really sweet.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish my hair was thicker though.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm trying to type as fast as I can in twenty minutes so I'm wondering how much I'll really end up typing.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't wait to go to college station this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope mom doesn't find out that I ran into that pole in the garage.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I'm just going to tell her that a car must have hit it.
TrainSen	00010	 I have the story all planned out and everything.
TrainSen	00010	 I'd much rather drive Karla's car to college station this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't wait to see Austin again.
TrainSen	00010	 He's so awesome.
TrainSen	00010	 I had so much fun at Emo's last night, Minus the Bear rocked.
TrainSen	00010	 Sometimes I feel out of place at that place though because it seems like everyone is trying to hard to look like they don't want to go crazy when the band is playing.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm so happy they played my favorite song, too.
TrainSen	00010	 I was surprised how many Victoria people were there too.
TrainSen	00010	 I think Nick is so cute too! I haven't seen Lynette in a while that was surprising.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if she still thinks I'm a bitch for all that crap in high school.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm starting to realize that Austin isn't as fun as I thought it'd be.
TrainSen	00010	 It's a crazy place to live, but after being in College Station all I think about is how fun it'd be to live there.
TrainSen	00010	 There's so many teenagers and so much to do at night.
TrainSen	00010	 The cat's distracting me it keeps trying to drink my water.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I hurt it when he flew off the table.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm going to make pizza to eat pretty soon here.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't remember the last time I ate at the same time Karla did.
TrainSen	00010	 Hopefully my car will be ready soon because this no ac is really pissing me off.
TrainSen	00010	 Which doesn't really matter anyways since there's no place to park without having to pay five dollars.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't like going to Eco class very much.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like the teacher is going to jump up and ask some question and I have no idea what he's talking about.
TrainSen	00010	 I haven't even been reading as much as I thought I would in school.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe I should start too because it'll probably start to get hard and then I really won't know what anyone's talking about.
TrainSen	00010	 I always wonder if Austin is getting tired of me.
TrainSen	00010	 I know he always thinks about getting with another girl, but I'd really like to see what he does and how he is when he's all drunk at some party.
TrainSen	00010	 That's going to be weird when he joins that frat but him and Roe fit in with them pretty good I think.
TrainSen	00010	 I know I should have joined that one group but I think I just wanted to know someone in it before I did.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think I could ever afford to pay that much money anyways.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't even hold on to a hundred in a week.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to stop buying so many clothes but there's too many cute things I want.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't wait to get regular cable, these channels suck.
TrainSen	00010	 I think me and Austin will last a long time, we don't fight at all, so maybe being far away can be a good thing.
TrainSen	01000	I hate writing assignments, especially ones that have to be typed.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm such a slow typer.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe I should take some sort of remedial typing course.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if they have those at UT.
TrainSen	01000	 It's weird how stressful this is I have such a short attention span, that makes it hard to just track and write my thoughts for twenty minutes, the fact that I'm quite possibly the world's slowest typer really doesn't help much either.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if anyone will ever read this.
TrainSen	01000	 The copying machine behind me is irritating, I wonder how many copies the girl is going to make, it seems like she has been making copies forever even though I've only been here for ten minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 Has it only been ten minutes?  Damn, I have to be in here for at least another ten.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm so hungry, I wonder what I should eat when I'm done with this.
TrainSen	01000	 For me, one of the hardest things about living alone for the first time is the matter of food.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't have much money and I certainly have no idea how to cook beyond the scope of heating up a microwave dinner or making some ramen.
TrainSen	01000	 Whenever I get hungry I have to choose between fast-food value menus and basically, just ramen.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss Kinsolving food, there was actually variety and with a swipe of my student ID I could eat as much as I wanted, and maybe even sneak some dessert out of the cafeteria to save for after they closed.
TrainSen	01000	 I should make more friends who live on campus so I can get them to buy me food with their meal plans, or at least go home and eat some of my mom's food.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow, my twenty minutes are up.
TrainSen	00100	I really wish I didn't have to do this.
TrainSen	00100	 Actually I don't want to do homework at all.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't like reading textbooks and that is all we have been doing.
TrainSen	00100	 I actually didn't even start reading any of my books until I knew I had to for an Economics quiz.
TrainSen	00100	 This weekend the plan was to catch up on everything and I really didn't.
TrainSen	00100	 I did catch up on economics, which is the hardest class I'm taking.
TrainSen	00100	 I am really disappointed that I didn't get to see my friends in Arlington, but I did get to hang out with my parents and that was nice.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss them but I love college and Austin.
TrainSen	00100	 I also hope that I get to hang out with my cousin more and get to know her a lot better.
TrainSen	00100	 Unfortunately our age difference is huge so we don't have too much in common but she has been calling and cooking for me so I don't mind that.
TrainSen	00100	 Cat's here and she's talking.
TrainSen	00100	 Jessica is here and she's messing with channels.
TrainSen	00100	 Earlier we watched the U.
TrainSen	00100	 S Open after she got home and we watched Justine Henin-Hardenne lose.
TrainSen	00100	 Yay.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh, I really have to sneeze and I'm kind of thirsty.
TrainSen	00100	 I really want to eat some peanut butter and crackers and maybe a taco.
TrainSen	00100	 One time our fridge was leaking stuff that looked like coke.
TrainSen	00100	 Today I talked to Alicia's mom more that I talked to her.
TrainSen	00100	 I actually didn't get to talk to her because her voicemail turned on.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope she is doing ok at UNT because she hasn't sound happy or upbeat when I have talked to her.
TrainSen	00100	 I talked to Amanda today too and now I'm so frazzled and distracted.
TrainSen	00100	 Cat and Jessica are loud and I can't even complete a train of thought.
TrainSen	00100	 It's kind of scary if a guy has a blow-dryer.
TrainSen	00100	 Is William Faulkner the dean? I don't know but I'm so excited about UT.
TrainSen	00100	 Jessica has a lot of clothes, food, and books and I think my dorm room is going to be vacuumed up by her stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 Today I bought milk, actually my mom bought milk, and then we drove to Kinsolving.
TrainSen	00100	 Later, I tried to put a fitted sheet onto my bed and it took a long time to put on and Jess made fun of me because I couldn't put it on.
TrainSen	00100	 I just told Cat that she couldn't have a Kleenex and it was pretty funny.
TrainSen	00100	 I really like college and all the people I have met so far.
TrainSen	00100	 They are so nice and I love them.
TrainSen	00100	Well, this assignment is interesting.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't think I have ever attempted to write for 20 minutes straight.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if I have ADHD or ADD or if its just because I am a drummer.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow! I have only gone for a minute and I am already bored.
TrainSen	00100	 Um.
TrainSen	00100	 I was watching the Cowboy game and they won 20-17.
TrainSen	00100	 Vinyl did well but threw an interception.
TrainSen	00100	 I think he will be good this year as lond as he doesn't get hurt.
TrainSen	00100	 He has a good delivery and is really good at reading defenses.
TrainSen	00100	 Speaking of defenses (I doubt this has any relation) but anyways I didn't make the hockey team today and it was really disappointing.
TrainSen	00100	 I really wanted to make it and thought that I had a decent chance.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I gave myself too much credit.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I am not big enough or something.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I could have made it but I suppose that one was up to the coach and God.
TrainSen	00100	 Speaking of God (random again) I went to a really neat church last Sunday.
TrainSen	00100	 Its name is Glad Tidings.
TrainSen	00100	 It is an assembly of God Church (although I am Lutheran I think it might be a good match because it has really awesome worship and the pastor gives interesting sermons).
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my old church though.
TrainSen	00100	 My youth minister back home is getting ordained this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 I am unsure if I should go home this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I will stay here because I really want to force myself to become independent even though that would entail me doing the laundry this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 I am really tired tonight but I suppose I will do my best to continue typing the entire 20 minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 But along the thought of the laundry business.
TrainSen	00100	 I have tried to hold off on doing it until next weekend (was going to do this weekend but I think I can make it until then).
TrainSen	00100	 It has been really hot lately.
TrainSen	00100	 It was brutal last Saturday trying to run in the morning.
TrainSen	00100	 It was so humid.
TrainSen	00100	 It eventually rained but not until after the practice.
TrainSen	00100	 I have never been so sore in my life.
TrainSen	00100	 I am still sore but I guess it doesn't matter seeing as I am not going to be playing for the team.
TrainSen	00100	 I suppose it is sort of a waste but maybe I will try and keep in shape.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know though.
TrainSen	00100	 We will see.
TrainSen	00100	 Well I am half-way there.
TrainSen	00100	 I am still tired and I am finding this assignment very boring and I suppose that would imply that my thoughts are boring.
TrainSen	00100	 Kind of sad I suppose.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I weren't so lonely tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 Just me and the TV.
TrainSen	00100	 A horrible invention it is.
TrainSen	00100	 Ruins relationships and limits time for many individuals.
TrainSen	00100	 But I suppose it helps many escape.
TrainSen	00100	 I like to escape by playing video games.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I might play one in a few minutes when I get done with this thing.
TrainSen	00100	 But yaw.
TrainSen	00100	 I really like my playstation and probably spend too much time on it but it is really fun and entertaining.
TrainSen	00100	 I am still tired.
TrainSen	00100	 Still tired but only about 7 minutes to go! Hurray! This makes me excited.
TrainSen	00100	 I didn't have an antecedent before the ""this"" nor did I there but that was because I quoted the previous mistake.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder who just walked by my room.
TrainSen	00100	 It sounded like two girls.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if there really is a girl out there for me.
TrainSen	00100	 Probably.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope so.
TrainSen	00100	 One can only hope can't one? It's funny, I accidentally made a typo and said can't none which if one thought about it logically would produce the same effect but if one thought about it from a Texas perspective it would have the opposite negative and depressing effect.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope for the logical.
TrainSen	00100	 I heard a Papa John's commercial.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder how they can claim they have ""better ingredients, or better pizza?"" It is subjective I would think.
TrainSen	00100	 There is another weather report on TV.
TrainSen	00100	 I find it interesting that people watch weather reports as if they could do anything to alter them (I usually just go with the flow).
TrainSen	00100	 The flow of the easy river I guess.
TrainSen	00100	 It is 11 o'clock.
TrainSen	00100	 Only a minute left.
TrainSen	00100	 Here's my chance to say something deep.
TrainSen	00100	 I really can't think of anything but live the Golden rule and you will find yourself a better person.
TrainSen	00100	 Love is all you need as Paul said (the Beatle of course.
TrainSen	00100	 Lol).
TrainSen	10000	College isn't at all what I thought it was going to be.
TrainSen	10000	 MAN, that French class is really kicking my but right now!!  But, I'm determined to suck it up and get through it with a decent grade!!  I feel so insignificant compared to John, he probably has no idea what it feels like to feel so behind everyone else!  But of coarse, I would never let on to that around him.
TrainSen	10000	 I really can't wait till I finish this semester and maybe next semester I will have a better experience.
TrainSen	10000	 I really think that 17 hrs for a freshman is a little too much, especially for me.
TrainSen	10000	 I really feel like I cheated someone out of a spot well earned here at UT.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't feel like I'm smart enough to be here.
TrainSen	10000	 But I'm sure that I'm not the only person that had those thoughts every now and then.
TrainSen	10000	 I really just hope I can keep a b avg so I can keep that scholarship!!!  I should probably make French a pass/fail class.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm just so jealous of people that catch on to language so quickly and leave students like me in the dust!!  Ah.
TrainSen	10000	 I should just be glad that I have the opportunity to explore myself here instead of griping about it 24/7.
TrainSen	10000	 And MOM!!!  she can't keep her mouth shut.
TrainSen	10000	 If I wanted John to know I wasn't feeling very confident then I would have told him!!!!  But of coarse, he calls and says, ""mom said you couldn't handle your FR class.
TrainSen	10000	 Well, just remember that school is your job!""  I know JOHN!!!!!!!!!!!  he just doesn't understand that I have too much pride in me to admit that, yeah, I was crying to mom that I really didn't know if I could keep up in French!  I hate it when he sees that ""failing"" side of me.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to be as invincible as he is.
TrainSen	10000	 And that's impossible.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't live up to his example!!  There's no way I'll graduate first in my class here at UT like he did and get some awesome job in new York that pays more money than I've ever seen at once!!!  It sux having a brother that had scholarships that paid all of his college expenses with money still left over!!!!!  He amazes me.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe that's my problem is I'm trying too hard and wasting all my energy to impress him!  Its not Mom, I know she just wants these years to be the best years of my life, but john wants them to be my JOB!!!!!!  What the hell!!!!  Can I not have a normal family that just is happy and supportive of me and understands that I am an individual that will do and accomplish different things than they ever did in different ways than they ever thought of!!!  Maybe UT's not for me.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe I'm meant to be at some rinkydink community college, where not that much is expected of me!!  But no.
TrainSen	10000	 That's not me.
TrainSen	00010	Okay dokey here we go.
TrainSen	00010	 just thought I would get this assignment out of the way before I'm overloaded with other stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 Or either put off until the last minute.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate when I do that.
TrainSen	00010	 Must not do that any more you know you can tell yourself that repeatedly but that doesn't mean that it is going to happen.
TrainSen	00010	 My past shows oh well.
TrainSen	00010	 Man my stomach hurts just got done eating a salad and now omg pain.
TrainSen	00010	 Why is that these days it seems like my stomach can't handle anything without getting upset gross.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh well listening to a new cd I got this weekend and I'm liking it.
TrainSen	00010	 The band was really good live too ill just have to go out and see them again sometime.
TrainSen	00010	 Omg this is a lot of writing for only 3 min.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel bad for the people who are going to read all the students papers.
TrainSen	00010	 20minutes of writing never seemed like so much well.
TrainSen	00010	 Now that I'm actually doing it I'm sure that there is going to be a few pages worth.
TrainSen	00010	 Once for another UT experiment I had to do this too and it was hand written for 20min I much better prefer the typing (is that even proper English.
TrainSen	00010	 Note to self again.
TrainSen	00010	 Work on grammar) ohm well at the other UT experiment that I was doing.
TrainSen	00010	 I was in high school and they put me in the back o f the library (never can spell that word) and told me to write about whatever it is we wanted for 20min.
TrainSen	00010	 Well there I am sitting writing away thinking to myself wow I've been writing for a long time.
TrainSen	00010	 Why haven't they called me up yet.
TrainSen	00010	 But I never saw the start time.
TrainSen	00010	 And sadly I ended up writing for 40min.
TrainSen	00010	 That is a lot especially be hand.
TrainSen	00010	 These days everyone it seems is so dependent on computers.
TrainSen	00010	 Good at times bad at other.
TrainSen	00010	 Only 14 minutes to go.
TrainSen	00010	 This has to be by far the most enjoyable assignment I have received so far.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I enjoy writing it seems to be relaxing.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I shall start writing in a journal again.
TrainSen	00010	 Although I only seem to write in my journal when I'm angry and htne lock it away until another god awful days comes along.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe I should start again but this time maybe daily or so.
TrainSen	00010	 Everyone says it is a stress reliever.
TrainSen	00010	 Ha-ha this cd is cute.
TrainSen	00010	 The lyrics crack me up at times.
TrainSen	00010	 He is talking about how the bank classifies him as ""poor"" because he doesn't have much money in the bank.
TrainSen	00010	 And believe me I know how that feels.
TrainSen	00010	 Grrrr I need to get some source of income.
TrainSen	00010	 Seriously.
TrainSen	00010	 Well my stomach is feeling better I wonder what the deal was.
TrainSen	00010	 Omg today after class.
TrainSen	00010	 Since I'm to stub run to wait for the bus I walked up the HUGE hill to c panking and today for the first time with a back-pack full of books!! OMG the walked own the hill doesn't compare to the walk up.
TrainSen	00010	 I thought I was going to die ha-ha but I guess its a good work out plus the what 50pounds of books Hahira damn good work out.
TrainSen	00010	 Man 9 minutes to go.
TrainSen	00010	 Good thing this essay isn't graded on grammar or spelling because I think I am the worst speller (that doesn't even sound like the right word) in the world.
TrainSen	00010	 But and English teacher of mine once told me that bad spelling is a sign of intelligence.
TrainSen	00010	 Hahahaha ironic.
TrainSen	00010	 He was a great teacher though I really miss his class.
TrainSen	00010	 He had a way of making the (at the team high school) students look at the world with open eyes.
TrainSen	00010	 More mature eyes .
TrainSen	00010	 Ha-ha and he would through in dark humor every once in a while .
TrainSen	00010	 Woke the class up.
TrainSen	00010	 Great teacher.
TrainSen	00010	 I've actually loved all my English teachers in high school although I am horrible at writing and reading.
TrainSen	00010	 But their classes were challenging and fun.
TrainSen	00010	 Everything else in school was to much of a breeze for me.
TrainSen	00010	 Although NOW at UT I'm a little scared.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope I can handle it.
TrainSen	00010	 I think as long as I can make it past the first year I should be able to have the hang of it and do fine the next couple of years .
TrainSen	00010	 Right ha-ha.
TrainSen	00010	 You know what this assignment reminds me of.
TrainSen	00010	 The new TV show THE DAYS.
TrainSen	00010	 How the teenager dude sits in his room and writes in his journal ha-ha too cute.
TrainSen	00010	 Didn't dugie houser (can't remember if that is his name or not) do the same thing.
TrainSen	00010	 Aww poor guy since he was  a doc at such a young age.
TrainSen	00010	 Don't you ever wonder if kids like that  miss out on their childhoods.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel bad for them.
TrainSen	00010	 Seeing ym younger bro and sis grow up hurts because now I know they are going to be exposed to the real world.
TrainSen	00010	 And they will no longer have that innocence and purity as they once did.
TrainSen	00010	 The real world is harsh.
TrainSen	00010	 Man if I could be 13 again I sure would.
TrainSen	00010	 Yet when I was 13 I remember wanting to be 16 and then wanting to be 18.
TrainSen	00010	 And not that I'm turning 19.
TrainSen	00010	 Ohm DEPRESSING.
TrainSen	00010	 Last year to be a teenager.
TrainSen	00010	 Although I never really did all the teenage stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 It was all to immature for me.
TrainSen	00010	 But soon I'm going to be 20 and that means.
TrainSen	00010	 Reaching adult.
TrainSen	00010	 You can't be called a kid anymore.
TrainSen	00010	 All though I love to call people kid all the time its the greatest.
TrainSen	00010	 people should call each other kid again maybe peoples outlook on life wouldn't be so scary.
TrainSen	00010	 Well 20min up.
TrainSen	00010	 I bet I look like I have ADD.
TrainSen	00010	 prob.
TrainSen	00010	 do.
TrainSen	00001	WELL I GUESS I CAN START WITH MY DREAM LAST NIGHT SINCE THAT IS WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ALL DAY.
TrainSen	00001	 it WAS SO CRAZY.
TrainSen	00001	 I had a dream that I was sitting on the couch in my room and talking with a friend when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door.
TrainSen	00001	 I open the door and it is a dark figure, like a person, but the lighting in my apartment was that of the time of day that dusk sets in.
TrainSen	00001	 Well she walks I and covers my mouth and lays me down on the floor and holds me with all force while she is chanting some mysterious chant in my ear.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know what she was saying but at that point I wake up in my dream as I'm struggling to move my body.
TrainSen	00001	 I couldn't move until I realized I was out of my dream, which was maybe 3 seconds later.
TrainSen	00001	 How creepy is that.
TrainSen	00001	 When I woke up the chant was repeating in my head for like 10 seconds and then I completely forgot it.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know what that was about but it seems to me that it has to do with someone putting a spell on me.
TrainSen	00001	 I've felt ghosts before but I never felt a bad sense coming from them.
TrainSen	00001	 Weird.
TrainSen	00001	 I always wonder what dreams are really supposed to mean.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean people can buy dream books all they want but what are the chances of those interpretations being the same for all of us? I am a little worried about that but I haven't really been a bad person in the past with anyone.
TrainSen	00001	 That I can think of.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways I have to really buckle down today and do some serious studying if I want to enjoy the weekend like I should.
TrainSen	00001	 Hopefully I will be studying on the beach Saturday night.
TrainSen	00001	 Not that the South Padre beach ids that beautiful.
TrainSen	00001	 After going to Cancun for a week though I guess its hard to actually top that beach.
TrainSen	00001	 That was the best time I believe in my life so far.
TrainSen	00001	 It is good to know that I will be going on many more trips like that considering how easy it was to plan that trip.
TrainSen	00001	 Saving the money was super hard but I feel like if I really want to do something I am capable of making that happen.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope this weekend is as good as last weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 I am going back to San Antonio to see my family since it has been two weeks since my last visit.
TrainSen	00001	 I really love the night life over here though.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe because everything is so new over here and I really love change period.
TrainSen	00001	 I am not scared to completely change my patterns in friendships and relationships for that matter.
TrainSen	00001	 I came over here knowing 3 people in the whole city.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I know just a few more but the possibility of me meeting so many more is very high on the scale.
TrainSen	00001	 I really miss my best friend a lot though.
TrainSen	00001	 Her and I hung out all summer together, and all last year in school for that matter.
TrainSen	00001	 She was all I needed and I was the same for her.
TrainSen	00001	 Now we are spirited and she's getting back with her boyfriend and will probably end up married with children.
TrainSen	00001	 Its a sad world when you see people you love so dependant on the wrong things at the wrong time.
TrainSen	00001	 Her relationship with that boy is so lame.
TrainSen	00001	 Thank god I have no time for stuff like that right now.
TrainSen	00001	 I cannot relate to her attachment to him and would love to keep it that way for a really long time.
TrainSen	00001	 Hopefully she will snap out of it though and realize that her whole life is ahead of her.
TrainSen	00001	 Man.
TrainSen	00001	 This is a really long time to be typing straight on the computer.
TrainSen	00001	 Everyone around me is getting annoyed by how much I am typing.
TrainSen	00001	 They keep staring at me, then the screen and back to me.
TrainSen	00001	 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Lets  see well I've been trying to explore the campus and look for spots to study that no one can find.
TrainSen	00001	 But unfortunately there are too many damn students in this place to accomplish that goal.
TrainSen	00001	 This Life Sciences Library is really nice.
TrainSen	00001	 I think its the high ceilings that make me feel so comfortable in here.
TrainSen	00001	 There are always open computers in here as well.
TrainSen	00001	 Well my time is almost up.
TrainSen	00001	 My experience in the psy class is very important to me considering I want to be a psychiatrist one day.
TrainSen	01000	I am in the library right now writing this stream of consciousness.
TrainSen	01000	 I just had dinner.
TrainSen	01000	 It was very delicious.
TrainSen	01000	 I ate at the Kinsolving dormitory food center.
TrainSen	01000	 The library is really quiet and I can hear the tying on the computer.
TrainSen	01000	 People are walking in and out and it is a little bit distracting.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait until this week is over.
TrainSen	01000	 It will be Labor day weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe a holiday is just around the corner.
TrainSen	01000	 It seems like just yesterday it was summer and I was having fun playing with my friends and hanging out.
TrainSen	01000	 Over the Labor day weekend, I would love to go back home to Houston and see my family, but I kind of would prefer to just stay here in Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 There is so much to do here and there is so much freedom.
TrainSen	01000	 In a way it can be good but I really need to manage my time wisely.
TrainSen	01000	 Today's psychology was really interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 I loved the in class experiment that was done.
TrainSen	01000	 It was pretty cool how the experiment worked especially since the first time was easy to tell when the girl was lying and the second time was really hard.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel tired right now and I would like to go to sleep, but I know I should get this writing assignment out of the way.
TrainSen	01000	 I was talking to my brother about computers today.
TrainSen	01000	 It was fun but hard at the same time since it was over the phone.
TrainSen	01000	 My mind went blank for a while and I can't think of anything to write.
TrainSen	01000	 Tomorrow is one of my best friend's birthday.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe she will be one year older.
TrainSen	01000	 She is a senior in high school right now and I bet she is stressing over college applications like I was during senior year.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope she gets everything done in time.
TrainSen	01000	 I remember senior year was really interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 I had to research a lot with colleges and what I wanted to do with my life especially choosing a major.
TrainSen	01000	 So far, education is what I want to do.
TrainSen	01000	 I think it will be fun especially if I decide to work with elementary students.
TrainSen	01000	 I am feeling really sleepy right now and I can feel my fingers moving more slowly than before.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss my family.
TrainSen	01000	 Even though I am used to being away for a month.
TrainSen	01000	 I know I will begin to miss them so much more in the next couple of months.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope they are doing well and everything is working out in their lives.
TrainSen	01000	 I also miss my friends back home especially my church family.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe I am actually going to say this or actually type it but I also miss my pastor.
TrainSen	01000	 Especially his sermons.
TrainSen	01000	 As I am here in Austin, I have been church hunting with some friends and the pastor's sermons here are just not the same.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I am really used to how he tried to make it apply to our daily lives and tried to really relate to us.
TrainSen	01000	 Especially since I grew up in that church, I really miss all the good memories I have made there.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait until the weather gets colder here in Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 I heard last year it snowed for a day in the morning.
TrainSen	01000	 I really would like to see falling snow.
TrainSen	01000	 I really love the cold weather and I like to play in the snow.
TrainSen	01000	 Today's weather was nice.
TrainSen	01000	 I could feel the cool breeze blowing in my face.
TrainSen	01000	 There was less sun than usual.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe it is supposed to rain who knows.
TrainSen	01000	 But I can definitely feel a weather change coming soon hopefully.
TrainSen	01000	 I still can't believe that I am a freshman in college.
TrainSen	01000	 I thought when I arrived here I would finally believe it but it is really hard to sink in.
TrainSen	01000	 So far classes have been fun and a little boring at the same time.
TrainSen	01000	 I try to think positively and try to learn something out of each time I spend in class.
TrainSen	01000	 I am really worried about the tests and quizzes here at the university.
TrainSen	01000	 I just don't know what to expect especially since different teachers do different things.
TrainSen	01000	 I really hope that I will do well in the first semester of college in fact I hope to do well all the years I am in college.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I've kind of forgotten how to study.
TrainSen	01000	 After college applications were done and over with and after I knew where I was going to attend college, I kind of stopped studying really really hard for classes.
TrainSen	01000	 I still studied but just not as hard and not as much as I should have.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like taking a shower and going to bed now.
TrainSen	01000	 My eyes feel they are slowing shutting but I'm trying to keep awake.
TrainSen	01000	 There are so many people here at the library.
TrainSen	01000	 I knew there would be a lot of people but it's amazing to see how a lot of people use their time wisely and study and also take the time to do their homework even when there are so many temptations to go out and party.
TrainSen	01000	 I suddenly feel itchy everywhere.
TrainSen	01000	 I think a bug bit me.
TrainSen	01000	 It is really annoying and itchy.
TrainSen	01000	 This has been the most exciting assignment ever.
TrainSen	01000	 It will be really weird to look back on what I wrote.
TrainSen	00100	I just clicked the go button for this writing assignment for psychology and I just almost misspelled psychology.
TrainSen	00100	 It is amazing how I can't spell psychology and how I still stumble on spelling it on the keyboard, psychology, I just did it again.
TrainSen	00100	 At the beginning and before this page there was a precautionary note that said if people were insecure about their confidentiality.
TrainSen	00100	 It is just an assignment, what could possibly go wrong.
TrainSen	00100	 The teacher or TA will steal your identity! If they do they some students should sue.
TrainSen	00100	 That is weird.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't believe I just wrote that.
TrainSen	00100	 I am writing this assignment now because I have some spare time and the writing assignment is due on Friday.
TrainSen	00100	 I do not even know when I would have done this assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 I have free time because my computer science class was, I guess canceled.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope it was canceled because I hate missing class.
TrainSen	00100	 It feels as if I am missing some knowledge that is necessary for my brain.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate when I am unsure if class is actually canceled.
TrainSen	00100	 Added to that, I hate when people are still in class sitting in the room waiting for class to start.
TrainSen	00100	 Those students make me uncomfortable because it seems as if they know (they don't) that we actually have class.
TrainSen	00100	 I am in the computer lab typing this writing assignment and I do not know what else to write about.
TrainSen	00100	 Let's think.
TrainSen	00100	 I am thinking.
TrainSen	00100	 Okay, I am in the corner, near corner of the computer lab and I am typing.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh yeah, speaking of writing assignments, my architecture writing assignment is going to be difficult because my TA wants us or prefers that we use Chicago style in our papers.
TrainSen	00100	 When he asked us if anyone did not know how to use Chicago everyone was quiet and a huge pregnant pause was present.
TrainSen	00100	 It is weird that teachers still do not understand that if students are quiet when they ask a question, nobody knows the answer.
TrainSen	00100	 It is weird.
TrainSen	00100	 I am now thinking if I am even doing this assignment correctly.
TrainSen	00100	 It seems as if I am ""tracking my thoughts"" of this past week.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope I still get credit for this class.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't even know this class is hard or easy yet.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I should reply that girl who mass emailed everyone and say that we should start a study group.
TrainSen	00100	 A study group would hopefully help me learn more about this subject.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope I can pass this class because as much as it is interesting I don't think I can sit through more of the same demos or demonstrations.
TrainSen	00100	 The experimental requirement is pretty cool.
TrainSen	00100	 I am almost done and I am happy about that.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't have to write a 5 page research paper.
TrainSen	00100	 Yeah!  Writing research papers can be a hassle.
TrainSen	00100	 Calculus is progressing fast and I am sort of surprised that I am grasping the notes real well.
TrainSen	00100	 I am understanding Calculus, weird.
TrainSen	00100	 Even though it is my major I still think that I should be able to be better than what I have been doing for that class.
TrainSen	00100	 Thirteen minutes and whatever seconds, is how long I have been typing so far.
TrainSen	00100	 This is sort of getting tiring.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder how psychologists interpret this writings.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait to read what the explanation for this writing assignment is.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it would be cool if one of our tests was just writing this kind of stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 ""Write what is on you Mind for 20 minutes"".
TrainSen	00100	 That would be weird.
TrainSen	00100	 It would be a completion test grade, which would be cool.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I have 4 more minutes,  and it is weird that I said 'think' because I can not subtract and I am a math major.
TrainSen	00100	 Well my calculus professor said that he has problems with simple arithmetic also so I am not that worried.
TrainSen	00100	 It always reassures me that teachers/professors have the ability to forgot simple things like that.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes myself better.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait for this timer to be over.
TrainSen	00100	 I am waiting and I am just typing stuff down.
TrainSen	00100	 I have 2 minutes left so when I am done with this minute I will have 60 seconds left.
TrainSen	00100	 So, yeah.
TrainSen	00100	 Time is dwindling down.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder how many people are doing this assignment right as I am doing this assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 What will I do after this.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh yeah I have to read for my next class.
TrainSen	00100	 Wait! I have to read for this class.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't believe I for got, I need to read for this class after my music class.
TrainSen	10000	I have just returned to my room from my biology class.
TrainSen	10000	 Madeline forgot her notes so she has borrowed mine so I cannot study them at the moment.
TrainSen	10000	 I am very excited because I got a full meal for only $3.
TrainSen	10000	 00! I got a free coke, a free corner of a sandwich, 2 free candy bars and I bought a berry and yogurt parfait for 3 bucks, which by the way was really tasty.
TrainSen	10000	 It is in my refrigerator now because I have only eaten breakfast about two hours ago.
TrainSen	10000	 Well tomorrow at 3:30 I will be done with classes for the week and I am thinking of driving home for the night to Lake Jackson.
TrainSen	10000	 It is a three hour drive, but I am not really homesick, just feel kind of lost.
TrainSen	10000	 The reason I'll tell anyone else for going home is to pick up my new computer.
TrainSen	10000	 See the one I have works fine plugged into the wall but for some reason unknown to myself and three Dell representatives/technical experts the battery will not charge.
TrainSen	10000	 SO they have sent me a entire system replacement, after first trying to merely replace the battery.
TrainSen	10000	 Which is what should happen because when one orders a $2000 system they would hope it would work.
TrainSen	10000	 So my next class is in about an hour and a half.
TrainSen	10000	 It is biology which is interesting to me for the most part.
TrainSen	10000	 It is my major, but I have been planning on changing it.
TrainSen	10000	 I chose it mostly because what I was interested in was medicine and I wanted to go to medical school after college.
TrainSen	10000	 Now, I am not quite sure that is what is for me, although it was never a sure thing.
TrainSen	10000	 Now I was thinking of changing to some sort of liberal arts degree where I could take more classes of interest to me and also Spanish which I recently tested out of 13 hours!! I could also go from there to med school or law school or whatever sort of graduate school I decide on.
TrainSen	10000	 There are so many decisions to be made.
TrainSen	10000	 Now that I have finally chosen a college.
TrainSen	10000	 I still am wondering about that decision.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean I Have always loved Texas, my dad went here and the school just has everything to offer.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe that is the problem too much?? I just sort of feel like I'm not fitting in, but then again isn't that what UT is about, being an individual? Well, I definitely like to be an individual and my own self, but I would like some friends, a group who'll call and see what I'm doing, call to hang out.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean I have been here only 11 days and I'm worried? Well not yet, I am still giving it time.
TrainSen	10000	 But I just feel so down on myself and anti-social.
TrainSen	10000	 The only people I have really hung around are from my hometown.
TrainSen	10000	 Not that it's all bad, I just was so ready to branch out into something NEW! So going home just seems like a good answer at the time, I even thought maybe I chose the wrong college, but how can I say that when I've been here not even two weeks.
TrainSen	10000	 At home, making friends was always easy.
TrainSen	10000	 I was the center of focus there.
TrainSen	10000	 Had everything, here there is so many that I am, well, unnoticed.
TrainSen	10000	 That in itself is a change.
TrainSen	10000	 But then I think isn't everyone else going through the same thing? Then if everyone else is, then why don't we just get together? Well I guess the world does not work that way.
TrainSen	10000	 But I have not given up yet, there is still hope.
TrainSen	10000	 The first football game is Saturday and I know that will reinforce my love for the school.
TrainSen	10000	 I loved going to the games when I wasn't a student at this school.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe I can meet some friends then.
TrainSen	10000	 So it is labor day weekend coming up.
TrainSen	10000	 Mostly I need to be studying, but that is what school is about.
TrainSen	10000	 I think we may float the river, so that will be fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I have started swimming this week and really want to go tonight, but I have a study session for Bio at 7pm, ,hopefully there will be enough time to get there swim, change and make it over to Welch.
TrainSen	10000	 I just am not sure how to work it all out.
TrainSen	10000	 drive, walk, ride the bus.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't live in a city and things are so different here.
TrainSen	10000	 The town I am from, I didn't even live in the city limits.
TrainSen	10000	 Hhmmmm.
TrainSen	10000	 but I really need to workout.
TrainSen	10000	 I am not going to get fat in college.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to lose pounds right now, not gain them.
TrainSen	10000	 But food is everywhere, I guess you can see by the free food.
TrainSen	10000	 Well maybe I can just eat some now and some between next class to prevent excess snacking.
TrainSen	10000	 But the candy bars aren't good.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok, before next class I need to read some bio and some psychology, but what I really want to do is lay in my bed, listen to music, watch TV maybe take a nap?.
TrainSen	10000	 Nope not here in the college world.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, I like to write down my thoughts it is soul clearing.
TrainSen	00001	This writing assignment seems a little silly.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean I'm probably going to spend the first 10 minutes of this thinking about the actual assignment and that doesn't seem very interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 Actually I'm already thinking about something else.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait for Austin City Limits.
TrainSen	00001	 We keep forgetting to buy tickets, I need to write that down.
TrainSen	00001	 I highly doubt it will sell out but I want to hurry up and buy them.
TrainSen	00001	 Jack Johnson is so good.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait to see him.
TrainSen	00001	 We definitely need more decorations in our room.
TrainSen	00001	 Fifty percent of our walls are still blank and its sort of depressing.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe that poster sale is still going on.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I'll have my mom send some of my posters from home.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to remember to call my mom later.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if she misses me a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh god, it's only been 3 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 This is getting a bit boring.
TrainSen	00001	 I really hope surprising Brian was a good idea.
TrainSen	00001	 I just hope Doug doesn't give it away.
TrainSen	00001	 Hell, I hope I don't give it away! I wonder if I'm doing this assignment right.
TrainSen	00001	 oh well Pennebaker said himself that no one was probably going to read it.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to do some calculus after this.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm so pumped I actually understood it today Hopefully it'll stay like this.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm so worried about the tests in that class.
TrainSen	00001	 Ill be so pissed if that class brings down my grade.
TrainSen	00001	 damnit I keep hitting something that makes the cursor jump lines its so annoying.
TrainSen	00001	 I just love Jack's voice, its so soothing.
TrainSen	00001	 Its hard to write as you think.
TrainSen	00001	 My thoughts are moving faster than my fingers.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope the other surveys I do online aren't as stupid as the one I just did.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm happy I guess, though, that it was so hard to name things I was dissatisfied with in my life.
TrainSen	00001	 I couldn't even think of ten.
TrainSen	00001	 I made up half of them.
TrainSen	00001	 well not exactly made up but they weren't things I was actually stressing over.
TrainSen	00001	 Was that even close to being grammatically correct? 7 minutes 30 seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 ahhh I hope this weekend is fun.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm looking at the football stadium out my window.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm excited for my first UT football game ever.
TrainSen	00001	 It better be good.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope our seats are good.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what Kelly's sister will be like.
TrainSen	00001	 hopefully fun and easy to talk to.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I meet a lot of people at the meeting I'm going to tonight.
TrainSen	00001	 Hopefully guys to be exact.
TrainSen	00001	 Although I bet its going to be a lot of chicks since its the university democrats.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope not everyone is a hippie/chip on their shoulder/ socialist type.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean I hope they're intelligent and not just the ""being different for the sake of being different type"" 10 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 half way there Yay! I'm really worried about Laura I hope she finds her dream job soon.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate seeing her depressed because I know she is but she doesn't talk about it.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope her and dell are working out.
TrainSen	00001	 he can be so oblivious sometimes.
TrainSen	00001	 Aren't most guys? My first instinct is to treat this like an essay and explain who I am talking about but I don't think this is supposed to be like an essay.
TrainSen	00001	 What the hell would a shrink get from reading this crap? It can't be very interesting to anyone else.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to go DVD shopping, our DVD collection is seriously lacking.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope raising our beds isn't that hard.
TrainSen	00001	 we definitely need a change in our room.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I want another bowl of lucky charms but I suppose I should finish this thing first.
TrainSen	00001	 4.
TrainSen	00001	 99 for a box of lucky charms! what a rip.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I should have know Cypress would be like that.
TrainSen	00001	 I should ask Kelly if she wants to go to the grocery store tomorrow.
TrainSen	00001	 It sucks not having a car down here.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss my jeep.
TrainSen	00001	 Its going to feel weird to drive when I get home.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't freaking wait!! 6 more minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess its going pretty fast.
TrainSen	00001	 This thing just seems like a waste of time but I guess it must have some purpose if we have to do it.
TrainSen	00001	 I actually need to finish reading for this class.
TrainSen	00001	 can't forget to do that.
TrainSen	00001	 wow looking at what I've wrote my thoughts seem pretty disorganized.
TrainSen	00001	 Hmm what does that say about me? I think being a therapist would suck.
TrainSen	00001	 I wouldn't be able to listen to depressed people whine all day long.
TrainSen	00001	 wow that sounded terrible.
TrainSen	00001	 But I suppose its true.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I'm just not patient enough 4 minutes I need to figure out how my scanner works.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to take pictures so I can send them to my family.
TrainSen	00001	 my fingers are starting to get tired.
TrainSen	00001	 I've typed a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 I still haven't found light bulbs for my stupid Ikea lamp.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe we can go to target tonight I think my punctuation and spelling as gotten worse as I went along.
TrainSen	00001	 oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 I think he said that we don't need any of that.
TrainSen	00001	 2 minutes Thinking about my thoughts is hard, I'm like freezing up.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what would happen if I hit the finish button now.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not going to try it because after all of this I want my credit for this assignment! I wish I was disciplined (spelling??) enough to keep a journal.
TrainSen	00001	 It would be fun to go back and read stuff like 5 years later.
TrainSen	00001	 I always start it and never pick it up again.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what that says about me? I'm busy.
TrainSen	00001	 ohhhh 50 seconds! I wonder what the FBA meeting will be like.
TrainSen	00001	 hopefully nice people will be there I wonder how much of a commitment it is.
TrainSen	00100	Ok, I guess I should be typing, that clock is making me kind of nervous.
TrainSen	00100	 Well, whatever, I just saw my roommate, I really didn't know she was going to be here.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel really nervous, I don't know why.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh yeah, I really need to work on my first paper for my English class.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope I get a good grade, because when I work on it, I feel as if it should be harder that what it actually is.
TrainSen	00100	 Gosh, my math class really sucked today.
TrainSen	00100	 I did not understand a word she was saying, but that's ok, because so did the rest of the class.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder what my mom is doing, oh and my dogs too.
TrainSen	00100	 I really miss them.
TrainSen	00100	 Even though my dog hates me and is kind of crazy, I miss him so much.
TrainSen	00100	 6 minutes, that's it! It feels as if I've been typing forever.
TrainSen	00100	 Before I forget I need to talk to Daisy today, man that girl is so crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 I also got to talk to Lillian, just to see how her day went.
TrainSen	00100	 Napoleon was being so funny last night, I really like talking to him at night, even though we talked until like midnight.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder what kind of music that guy is going to play in my psychology class.
TrainSen	00100	 He usually plays weird music, today it's going to have to do with the brain, that'll be interesting, I suppose.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope I'm doing this right.
TrainSen	00100	 Who ever reads this, if it's ever actually read, will probably think it was lame.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh, well.
TrainSen	00100	 You're also going to find plenty of mistakes, opps my bad.
TrainSen	00100	 Gosh, that sounded like a line out of that movie: Clueless.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel clueless a lot, so that's ok.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait to go to sleep, that's one of my favorite things to do ever since school started.
TrainSen	00100	 This past 3-day weekend was great because I got to wake up so late and just hang around my dorm with my roommate.
TrainSen	00100	 She's cool.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm so glad I get along with my roommate, because I've been hearing some roommate horror stories lately, I guess I lucked out.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow, I've been writing for 16 minutes! I guess it was harder to get started.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if the people around me think I'm writing like this really long email to someone.
TrainSen	00100	 they're probably thinking I'm a loser, ha-ha.
TrainSen	00100	 that's kind of funny to think about.
TrainSen	00100	 Daisy is probably talking to her internet boyfriend right now at a computer on campus.
TrainSen	00100	 Her boyfriend is so funny.
TrainSen	00100	 Some girl just sat next to me, I hope she doesn't read this.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what else to say, my time is almost out.
TrainSen	00100	 Ahhhh! I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this.
TrainSen	00100	 Well my time is up, it was great, but I've got to print out my biology lecture.
TrainSen	00010	Well, I have to confess, this is an extremely difficult thing for me to do.
TrainSen	00010	 I am an extremely objective person and it's hard for me focus on something when there is no clear goal in sight, but maybe this will get easier as I go.
TrainSen	00010	 I hear TV in the next room.
TrainSen	00010	 My mom is in the kitchen and watching the Republican National Convention.
TrainSen	00010	 I really should be watching it you because you see I'm a government major (at least that's the plan right now).
TrainSen	00010	 However, and ironically, the very thing that is going to earn me my government major is also what is keeping me from watching the convention.
TrainSen	00010	 There now talking about Kerry not being a good leader but the AC which is located next to my room has just come on and now I can't hear.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow, this is getting a little weird having to make myself consciously voice in writing what I'm thinking.
TrainSen	00010	 It's amazing you can be so unaware of the thoughts that your own brain  is thinking.
TrainSen	00010	 Ah, pancakes are ready.
TrainSen	00010	 I would like to go eat them now but I'm stuck here for another 9 minutes and 43 seconds.
TrainSen	00010	 OOppss, she used baking soda instead of baking powder.
TrainSen	00010	 No pancakes I guess.
TrainSen	00010	 I went to the Phantom of the Opera last semester.
TrainSen	00010	 It was a Broadway production and vg.
TrainSen	00010	 I have a pamphlet from the evening sitting on my desk, which is why I bring it up.
TrainSen	00010	 I was depressing though, for all  the talent and wonderful set changes.
TrainSen	00010	 Do you like  the sound of the AC.
TrainSen	00010	 I  do.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why but it comforts me.
TrainSen	00010	 I think the reason it does is because when I was younger the AC would come and there was a vent right over my bed  so to keep warm I would have to snuggle deeper into my covers and I like to snuggle.
TrainSen	00010	 That was a run on sentence but that's how I think, in run ons, so I'm just trying to be accurate.
TrainSen	00010	 I had to look up how to spell sentence.
TrainSen	00010	 Yes, I know that's horrible, but you see I'm a very phonetically spell, always have been, and so it's very  hard for  me to distinguish between the phonetically pronunciations of vowels.
TrainSen	00010	 Like in the word sentence, I'm always unsure if it's sentence or sentence.
TrainSen	00010	 Another example is that I used to spell ""they"" ""they"" because the e sounded like a long a to me.
TrainSen	00010	 I better fix that if I'm going into government.
TrainSen	00010	I am overwhelmed with lots of work.
TrainSen	00010	 Yesterday was very productive, and I intend for today to be the same way.
TrainSen	00010	 I have no history to work on but I have to work on some Latin and some astronomy and go to a help session.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to call Andrew and see if he wants to go see Thomas in College Station this Sunday.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope he wants to do that because I want to be here on Saturday so that I can watch the football game in Austin and spend time with Matthew and study Saturday.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to eat some lunch soon but I have some things I need to get done before that.
TrainSen	00010	 The lawn mower outside is very annoying, and I hate that there seems to never be a good time of the day for people to mow lawns.
TrainSen	00010	 Last year they would start the mowers at 7 when I was sleeping and it bugged the hell out of me.
TrainSen	00010	 There is a party on 6th tonight that I might go to but I am not sure of that, because I don't really like the group of people that are going.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't want Matthew to go to that party in North Austin because he will end up staying there, and that makes me uncomfortable.
TrainSen	00010	 This guy is going to Acc and his parents are going out of town so he is having a party.
TrainSen	00010	 That sounds a little bit like high school to me.
TrainSen	00010	 The people I have met from ACC just don't seem to have work ethic and I just don't understand how someone could not want to try their best to get far.
TrainSen	00010	 I have noticed that there are many people at this school that don't think twice when they speak up, thoughts are never concluded when people begin to speak.
TrainSen	00010	 There is too much individualism, people only want to listen to themselves talk.
TrainSen	00010	 We live in a society where people are obsessed with themselves.
TrainSen	00010	 I find that in history very few people make educated assumptions when reading literature.
TrainSen	00010	 They pawn off what the professor says and act like it is their own words.
TrainSen	00010	 I  love Bob Dylan, people always ask him what his lyrics mean and he always just says "" oh, their just words"".
TrainSen	00010	 Its great, I love it.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to call my mommy today cause she called me last night, I saw this dog on campus today with its owner and it made me miss Emma at home.
TrainSen	00010	 I love that dog, she is so cute, I swear she has human tendencies.
TrainSen	00010	 I just miss coming home this summer and coming home to a dog that is so happy to see you.
TrainSen	00010	 I love dogs so much, I can't wait to be able to have my own.
TrainSen	00010	 Aww, my computer has been making the most annoying sound in the world lately, and I can't stand it, it is just this sound that keeps on going, never gets worse or better, it just lulls, and drives me crazy.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate this place so much sometimes.
TrainSen	00010	 there is too much estrogen in this building, and the fact that guys are only allowed on the weekends kills me.
TrainSen	00010	 Why can't my brother come up here during the week, I just don't get it.
TrainSen	00010	 It is so old fashioned.
TrainSen	00010	 I understand they want it to be a learning environment conducive to studying, but millions of college kids live in places where sexes can mingle and people make their grades.
TrainSen	00010	 yesterday felt like my true beginning of the semester.
TrainSen	00010	 I had a full day of academics.
TrainSen	00010	 I started around 8 and didn't finish till around 12, and I went to sleep so exhausted that I had no trouble falling asleep.
TrainSen	00010	 But, I wake up in the morning with my back so sore.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know if all this work is just stressing me and giving me pains in my body, I don't know.
TrainSen	00010	 I just know it isn't' from working out, cause I haven't done that in a while.
TrainSen	00010	 I am perfectly fine with my appearance at the moment, I haven't gained any weight in a long time, and I don't want to let myself.
TrainSen	00010	 Last year I gained like 5 pounds and I hated myself for it, but luckily I lost it.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to take more pics and get that battery charged, it is annoying that my dad has that charger.
TrainSen	00010	 I wont go home until Texas v ou so I won't get it until then, damn.
TrainSen	00010	 I really want the fall to come, where the days are always in the 60's and 70's it is such beautiful weather, and no humidity so my hair doesn't go crazy on me.
TrainSen	00010	 Arg, I just need to pace myself today, I don't want to be doing work late tonight, I want to finish around 8 or something, that would be nice.
TrainSen	10000	this is raechal collins.
TrainSen	10000	 my feelings are good right now.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I am going home this weekend for the first time since I've been up here.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know if it is for sure yet, but I'm excited to see everyone that I haven't seen in a while.
TrainSen	10000	 my roommate is in a bad mood because she found out her ex boyfriend is dating a junior in high school which is just gross.
TrainSen	10000	 also, one of my best friends from high school isn't very happy.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know why but she just doesn't seem happy.
TrainSen	10000	 my absolute best friend in the world is coming down this weekend though so I might be staying in Austin for that.
TrainSen	10000	 I just want to go home to see my boyfriend, or whatever it could be considered.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm waiting for him to write me back right now.
TrainSen	10000	 even though I can't really write him back because I'm writing on this thing for twenty minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm excited about this class.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
TrainSen	10000	 it's by far my most interesting one, next to swimming.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm excited for that one cause it will be a good form of exercise and I need a way to get some exercise up here.
TrainSen	10000	 since all I seem to be doing is eating.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder how everything is back home.
TrainSen	10000	 it's really hard to do the long distance thing, but its weird how they say time apart can make the heart grow fonder, when all it has done to me is make me grow more detached.
TrainSen	10000	 in a way, I guess it is good, but at the same time, it's kind of sad, because if I was home right now, everything would be the same, and we would be together.
TrainSen	10000	 except now I'm here and I need to branch out and meet new people.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm also doing this sorority business and I really don't know if it's meant for me.
TrainSen	10000	 I like it, but I mean it seems like its just girls who join a group to get ""sisters for life"" and I don't know if it is something I want to spend all my time and parent's money doing.
TrainSen	10000	 I never realized how much things coasted until I came here.
TrainSen	10000	 it is absolutely insane.
TrainSen	10000	 now I have to actually keep track of my money and its so hard.
TrainSen	10000	 I had no idea how much I spent a month.
TrainSen	10000	 I hate my anthropology class.
TrainSen	10000	 it's hard and I don't understand what's going on in there.
TrainSen	10000	 also my teacher is blind which is really cool and respectable but its almost distracting because I find myself staring at his guide dog or wondering what he's feeling since he is standing in front of a class of 100 plus and he can't see them.
TrainSen	10000	 for all he knows we could be throwing stuff leaving class eating drinking and being absent.
TrainSen	10000	 my friend is being shady and trying to rub in getting her third choice sorority when my other friend got first.
TrainSen	10000	 it is weird.
TrainSen	10000	 we have to figure out where I am living next year.
TrainSen	10000	 it is kind of stressful because every body knows where they are living and I don't have a clue cause I haven't thought about it once.
TrainSen	10000	 tomorrow night I am going to the ato pledge line.
TrainSen	10000	 it should be fun a lot of my guy friends went ato so I like hanging out with them.
TrainSen	10000	 I like my roommate jen.
TrainSen	10000	 she is a badass and we all have fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I also like Kelley, my other roommate.
TrainSen	10000	 actually they are both my suite mates my roommate is Kim from high school.
TrainSen	10000	 it made it easier moving in and stuff with a roommate I already knew.
TrainSen	10000	 I would have hated moving in a finding that my roommate was someone who didn't speak English or like hated life or something like that.
TrainSen	10000	 this twenty minutes is lasting longer than I thought.
TrainSen	10000	 I didn't expect to write this much.
TrainSen	10000	 Romeo and Juliet is playing in my room right now, and I love this movie.
TrainSen	10000	 I haven't seen it in forever either.
TrainSen	10000	 I remember when it first game out I was obsessed with Leonardo deception.
TrainSen	10000	 now in real life, he is not at hot as he used to be.
TrainSen	10000	 he just killed himself in the movie.
TrainSen	10000	 the ending of the movie/play is very depressing, and my arms and wrists are starting to hurt with all this typing.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to pick out an outfit to wear to the ato thing tomorrow night.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I'm supposed to wear a cocktail dress.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't want to get all dressed up.
TrainSen	10000	 I've done enough dressing up for the past week during rush.
TrainSen	10000	 welp, the twenty minutes is over, it was nice talking to you computer.
TrainSen	01000	this is getting really old this is my second time doing this because the page keeps shutting down or going back and I have no idea what's happening to my other writings.
TrainSen	01000	 so now I'm getting really annoyed because I have other homework to be doing .
TrainSen	01000	 I also have to do the prescreening because I tried doing it last night and the computer kept crashing.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm watching the sandlot I remember this movie from when I was a little kid me and my brothers would always watch it.
TrainSen	01000	 they always tried to make me watch Michael Myers and I'm so scared of him.
TrainSen	01000	 they used to dress up like him and have his mask and hide in my room at night.
TrainSen	01000	 they were pretty mean to me.
TrainSen	01000	 now that I'm gone I miss them so much.
TrainSen	01000	 mayra and john keep arguing and whispering stuff to each other and I wish they would stop they make it so obvious that they don't want me to hear.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I don't have to start over again because that's going to make me so mad.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm going to the incubus concert next week and I'm so excited the only thing that sucks though is that I have a test on Monday in this class and also my precal class which means I have to hurry up and study and not slack off.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't want to be one of those students who mess up at the very beginning of their college years and then wish they wouldn't have.
TrainSen	01000	 this timer is going really slow and I'm getting really sleepy I didn't go to bed until six in the morning.
TrainSen	01000	 I was up watching videos and eating cereal today is Nichol's birthday and instead of me buying her something she bought me a glow in the dark wish bear.
TrainSen	01000	 I thought that was very sweet of her but I feel bad because I have no idea what to get her for her birthday she has everything that she could possibly want.
TrainSen	01000	 were going to go eat at red lobster on Saturday and were going to the movies to watch wicker park.
TrainSen	01000	 I already saw that movie this weekend but I liked it so I want to see it again.
TrainSen	01000	 it was about a girl who becomes obsessed with this guy.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder why people become obsessed with others I mean does it have to do something with their brain or is it just lust and they want to get their way.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I do good in college I don't want to mess up.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not even sure what I want my major to be.
TrainSen	01000	 I was premed at the beginning and I still am but it seems really difficult and it needs a lot of determination and hard work.
TrainSen	01000	 I know I could do that if  I really wanted to but I want to have a life outside of school and it seems that's all that doctors have time for, books and work.
TrainSen	01000	 so I'm getting really hungry and my head is starting to hurt john and mayra are still arguing and I don't like it at all.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel bad when people argue because I feel I should try to make everything better.
TrainSen	01000	 I know its usually none of my business but I like to make people happy.
TrainSen	01000	 all of my friends tell me that's a bad quality because I never end up doing what I want.
TrainSen	01000	 but the thing is I don't want to hurt anyone especially those I care about.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I'm hiding so many things from so many people but they would never understand me and plus I don't want to disappoint them.
TrainSen	01000	 I know that if they really loved me they would understand and be happy for them but I'm not sure I want to take that chance especially if I don't even know what's going to come out of it.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm probably not making any sense right now and I wish this would hurry up because they are really getting mad now and I'm using johns computer so I feel like I'm using him and mayra is getting mad at him and he is doing me a favor by letting me use it.
TrainSen	01000	 they left the TV on a baseball game and I don't want to watch that.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to go and check in with my job because I need to start working already.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm running out of money and I don't want to ask my mom for money because she has bigger things to worry about I just want to make it on my own and make her proud.
TrainSen	01000	 they are all doing so much for me to be here that I don't want to make them doubt why they believe in me so much.
TrainSen	01000	 I really want to go home and watch TV and fall asleep and forget about everything that's going on right now I feel like pretty soon everything is going to crash and burn and its going to be all my fault and I'm going to be left with nothing except regret.
TrainSen	01000	 I regret not being honest with everyone right now but I'm just trying to take things one day at a time.
TrainSen	01000	 hopefully everything will get easier and make more sense because I have no idea what I'm going to do if it doesn't.
TrainSen	00001	Well, I today I'm feeling pretty lovely.
TrainSen	00001	 I woke up this morning and went to the gym.
TrainSen	00001	 Afterwards I took a shower and went downstairs to get something to eat.
TrainSen	00001	 I met up with this boy I am talking to, he's really sweet and sexy.
TrainSen	00001	 He makes me feel special.
TrainSen	00001	 But I'm being very cautious in this little relationship, because I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve, and I don't feel like getting hurt.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways,  my sandwich was really good.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm also watching Seinfeld right now.
TrainSen	00001	 Actually if you want to be technical with it, I'm not watching it because I'm typing right now, but it's on in the background.
TrainSen	00001	 But yah, I love Seinfeld.
TrainSen	00001	 I think it's the greatest show in the world.
TrainSen	00001	 I am still amazed at how someone can write a nine season show about NOTHING.
TrainSen	00001	 That's crazy.
TrainSen	00001	 You know what else I think is crazy?  I don't know how in world I'm going to manage my time between classes and work-study and the gym and my social life.
TrainSen	00001	 It's like there is so much to do.
TrainSen	00001	 Especially with all this reading I have to do for psy.
TrainSen	00001	 Now that's crazy!  Why do we have to read so much.
TrainSen	00001	 Why can't the teacher just teach it to us.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I'm just being lazy.
TrainSen	00001	 Who knows?  Yes! Another episode of Seinfeld is coming on.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways, on Monday there's a Seinfeld marathon.
TrainSen	00001	 It starts at 7am until the end of Labor Day.
TrainSen	00001	 That is really cool.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait.
TrainSen	00001	 But yah.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what grade I'm going to get in this class.
TrainSen	00001	 I've done all my experiments.
TrainSen	00001	 I be damned if I had to write some 5 page psychological paper.
TrainSen	00001	 So you know I got started on those experiments ASAP.
TrainSen	00001	 Okay! Anyways, I really don't know what else to write about.
TrainSen	00001	 So lets see.
TrainSen	00001	 let me think.
TrainSen	00001	 What else can I talk about.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh yeah! There's a football game tonight.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope we win.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I could go, but I didn't but any tickets.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't even know where to buy tickets from.
TrainSen	00001	 I should of just got a sports package.
TrainSen	00001	 That would of made my life a whole lot easier.
TrainSen	00001	 I have this football player in my class.
TrainSen	00001	 Actually he's in two of my classes.
TrainSen	00001	 He's nice.
TrainSen	00001	 We study together, because our rhetoric class is kind of difficult, and he's always falling asleep in class.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't blame him.
TrainSen	00001	 They work those football players really hard.
TrainSen	00001	 A little bit too hard.
TrainSen	00001	 That's just ridiculous.
TrainSen	00001	 Sometimes I feel for them, because like how do they expect them to do good in school, when there only getting like 5hrs of sleep a day.
TrainSen	00001	 That's not good, especially with all that strenuous activity they do.
TrainSen	00001	 I know I wouldn't be able to do it.
TrainSen	00001	 I know after I come back from the gym, I'm ready to go back to sleep.
TrainSen	00001	 So I really feel for the football players.
TrainSen	00001	 But I guess if you really want to make it to the NFL, you got do it.
TrainSen	00001	 You got to stick with it.
TrainSen	00001	 And that really goes for anything.
TrainSen	00001	 If you want to accomplish any of your goals, then you have to stick with the game plan.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyway, you know it really hasn't hit me that I am in college yet.
TrainSen	00001	 I mean it kind of hit me last week, when I was going out with some of my friends.
TrainSen	00001	 And it was like, I don't have to call my mom and tell her what I'm doing, I don't have to worry about her sending out a search party for me.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't have to answer to nobody.
TrainSen	00001	 It's so great.
TrainSen	00001	 I love this!  Anyway, the way I see it if I just find out some way to manage my time with work, gym, classes, and my social life then everything should just work out fine.
TrainSen	00001	 Yah in a perfect world.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways, looks like I got about 4 more minutes to right.
TrainSen	00001	 Okay lets, see.
TrainSen	00001	 You know what my favorite episode of Seinfeld is?  The very first episode, when Jerry and George where doing laundry.
TrainSen	00001	 That's a really good episode.
TrainSen	00001	 I know like every word, scene, move.
TrainSen	00001	 everything about that episode.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways, looks like I'm going on only two minutes left.
TrainSen	00001	 Two minutes and forty seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 Two minutes and 30 seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 Two minutes and 20 seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 Two minutes and 10 seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 Two minutes and now we have ONE MINUTE LEFT.
TrainSen	00001	 All right I'm on a roll here.
TrainSen	00001	 Lets see, I guess I'll just sign off now.
TrainSen	00001	 Well this has been really fun.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope whoever is reading this has enjoyed reading this.
TrainSen	00001	 Have a great day and a great like.
TrainSen	00001	 5 seconds left .
TrainSen	10000	It's a bit past 4 pm on a Sunday, and I only just woke up a while ago.
TrainSen	10000	 So here I am, writing a psychology paper which has no definite topic as such.
TrainSen	10000	 I usually listen to laid back electronic-type music when I do papers, which is what I'm doing now.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel it helps me free up my mind, and help me think more clearly.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know how this paper is going to end up, or whether I'm writing what I'm supposed to, but I suppose that's the point of the exercise.
TrainSen	10000	 So - tracking my thoughts.
TrainSen	10000	 Well first off I just realized how annoying the timer at the top of the page is.
TrainSen	10000	 Watching it tick away while thinking of something to write (which shouldn't be a problem anyway since I'm supposed to write what I'm thinking and not the other way around) just seems to get on my nerves a bit.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder what the rest of the writing assignments this semester will be like though.
TrainSen	10000	 They need to fix this page up though, it didn't work in my primary web browser, Mozilla Firefox, and I don't like Internet Explorer all that much.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh, the music just changed, it's a bit faster and slightly more aggressive now.
TrainSen	10000	 I got myself some candy too, though I probably shouldn't have since I'll be having lunch in a bit.
TrainSen	10000	 It's getting a bit warmer in here, someone probably increased the air conditioner temperature again.
TrainSen	10000	 And now my roommate is playing basketball outside in the living room.
TrainSen	10000	 One of these days I think he's going to break something.
TrainSen	10000	 10 minutes and the clock's ticking.
TrainSen	10000	 I really should get some work done today.
TrainSen	10000	 I pretty much wasted the last two days, but hey, what are three day weekends for? I've got some Math and CS homework, as well as a freshman seminar paper.
TrainSen	10000	 Math's an interesting class even if it is too easy.
TrainSen	10000	 Not to sound self deluded, but I do think I know more calculus than most people in that class, at least so far.
TrainSen	10000	 Computer Science is a different story though.
TrainSen	10000	 The class is a bit harder than I expected it to be, but nothing beyond me.
TrainSen	10000	 A little googling and I should easily be able to look up anything I don't already know and complete the assignment.
TrainSen	10000	 Java isn't really one of my strengths, but that doesn't mean I can't make it one.
TrainSen	10000	 I like psychology though, at first I thought it would be impersonal and intimidating because of the sheer number of students in it but that's changed.
TrainSen	10000	 17 minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 I just have to continuously keep looking at the timer.
TrainSen	10000	 And the music just stepped up, now it's a bit faster than before.
TrainSen	10000	 And I actually got this paper done! I'm so proud of myself!  well, not really, but I'm glad I got it done anyway.
TrainSen	10000	 And now my mind's a blank really.
TrainSen	10000	 Looks like my time's up.
TrainSen	10000	 Did I mention I hate popups? Time to click the finish button.
TrainSen	01000	     well, I wonder why I'm here.
TrainSen	01000	 languages can be a real problem especially when you have 100 pages to read every day.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe this is what people called college live.
TrainSen	01000	 no time, no entertainment, no nothing.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe it's not the case for native students!  so why am I here?  Am I anywhere better than them?  Or will I ever be better than this advantaged people?  what advantage will I receive once I finish this college hell?  hell with it.
TrainSen	01000	 It's not so bad actually.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know.
TrainSen	01000	 There are so many things I want to do, but don't have time for.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to fit into the class room, so I got to read the textbook, pretending that I'm cool with it.
TrainSen	01000	 Who knows how I'm doing?  I don't even know that.
TrainSen	01000	 Sometimes I wonder what will come after.
TrainSen	01000	 After all this years of staying and trying to fit into a culture that I don't even like.
TrainSen	01000	 Is it money that draw me here?  Or is it something else?  Maybe I'm just tried of what I used to do.
TrainSen	01000	 Although I don't know exactly what.
TrainSen	01000	 Live repeats itself, again and again that I don't know whether I've done it already or it's just a similar experience.
TrainSen	01000	 Memories are tricky.
TrainSen	01000	 They fool you, mislead you, and abandon you.
TrainSen	01000	 Am I here for the 2nd time? Or even more than that?  What am I searching for?  Trying to reach a perfect life?  I wonder how many times more do I have to live in order to achieve that.
TrainSen	01000	 Enough for the questions.
TrainSen	01000	 since there will be no answers to that.
TrainSen	01000	 Austin is a nice place.
TrainSen	01000	 The weather is quite similar to Taiwan, but not as humid.
TrainSen	01000	 People are busy, as they did in community college.
TrainSen	01000	 but the more people there are, the easier you fall into isolation.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't remember when I get my first ""friend"" in college, but people seemed more relaxed back then.
TrainSen	01000	 Memories make things look at its best.
TrainSen	01000	 That's how human survives.
TrainSen	01000	 Cell phone is also a devise that's supposed to do so.
TrainSen	01000	 But do they?  People get more and more dependent on such thing.
TrainSen	01000	 They want to be connected.
TrainSen	01000	 but with whom?  What's the meaning of saying hi on the phone and trying to find a correct time to hang up though out the conversation?  Cell phone is tiring.
TrainSen	01000	 They only work when you need to be picked up.
TrainSen	01000	 There lots of quite Asian girls on campus; I wonder where they're from.
TrainSen	01000	 Are they having the same troubles?  I don't see any good looking Asian guys out there.
TrainSen	01000	 Too bad, it's always easier to find good looking girls than guys.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, as long as it nurture my eyes.
TrainSen	01000	 Not being able to see good looking things can be a torture!  That brings me to another problem in Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 No comic book store!!!  And I can't even watch the DVDs I brought.
TrainSen	01000	 Damn capitalistic Americans.
TrainSen	01000	 Region settings is plane stupid.
TrainSen	00100	     I smell soy sauce in are hall some girl spilled it all over the place and now you can't be anywhere without smelling the nasty odor.
TrainSen	00100	 Well I got back from a bible study got to see some people that I haven't seen in a while I suppose it made me feel at home and I actually made plans to hang out with someone I met this summer and haven't been able to see him that much.
TrainSen	00100	 Anyways I enjoyed it but at the same time I wonder about my relationship with God I suppose it is a thought that always lingers in my mind.
TrainSen	00100	 Is it strong enough to I pursue him enough am I a good person sometimes I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 so I'm listening while I do this music seems to be something that I have always enjoyed the way everything flows together and becomes something more than noise it seems that music in some forms is the perfection of the interpretation of emotions it not only puts words towards your feelings it gives the words syntax by adding in a conglermation of cacophonies that seem to support the words, Now even though some music doesn't appeal to me I believe that if anyone is writing the music backed by emotion and truth or feelings then they have earned my respect if that really means anything but to those who rock you have got my salutations.
TrainSen	00100	 So lets get real I'm an 18 guy so I do also think about girls quite a bit.
TrainSen	00100	 Today I thought of a girl in high school I missed and it is always an itching feeling or thought in the back of my head to try to commit to a girl or girlfriend.
TrainSen	00100	 Even though I don't know what the hell I want to be honest, is that all this world is trying to please ourselves in order to feel worthy, who are we trying to impress.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know? but I can't deny my feeling I believe that truth lies in your emotions and that god gives you certain emotions that give you truth in your life.
TrainSen	00100	 Sometimes I feel that the only thing we have here on this planet is love that's all we have that is really worth any value and if we give it away to others that is the only way to truly fulfill not only yourself but others, Live life love life.
TrainSen	00100	 So as I continue to right I remind myself that love exist and to give it freely to those who are in my life.
TrainSen	00100	 I find myself always observing people walking to class its amazing how afraid people are to look at each  other simple glances are rarely seen.
TrainSen	00100	 what a society it would be if people simply acknowledged each other in life.
TrainSen	00100	 So many lonely people.
TrainSen	00100	 What do I like: the smell of rain, the sound of a harmonica and an acoustic guitar blending together like reunited twins, the smell of the mountains the feeling of seeing the sunrise and the gratefulness of seeing it set knowing that were alive and living I met an 80 year man this weekend he told me that life was to good and he didn't want it to end.
TrainSen	00100	 I agree some people have forgotten that but I hope that one day the world will realize that being alive is the hope that we all have has long as are heart keeps beating there is something to do something to live for, someone to love, something to give, man being a kid was freaking awesome and I could play all day doing something as simply as climbing a tree or hide and seek and it was amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I had a glass of milk before I went to bed but hey what can you do.
TrainSen	00100	 Well there went 20 minutes I suppose I will go a little over to leave a quote from jerry Garcia ""live life to the fullest and in death all you can be is grateful.
TrainSen	00010	     How much time do I have before I need to do some more homework.
TrainSen	00010	 This week is going to be pretty busy.
TrainSen	00010	 It is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out.
TrainSen	00010	 All the teachers should use the same service.
TrainSen	00010	 This would make it much easier for students to keep up.
TrainSen	00010	 My goal is not to fall behind, but I have missed some classes of geology.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to find out what I missed.
TrainSen	00010	 That class is going to suck.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I had a car so that I could get places farther than a mile away.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate writing.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate typing.
TrainSen	00010	 It is hard to write down everything you think.
TrainSen	00010	 Our minds work 5 or 6 times faster than one can type or speak.
TrainSen	00010	 So if we could talk faster, we could get up to 5 times the amount of information to someone else, leaving us with more free time.
TrainSen	00010	 This would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm glad my spider bite went away.
TrainSen	00010	 It sucked that I had to go to the health center for it.
TrainSen	00010	 They gave me a shot in my ass.
TrainSen	00010	 It left a bruise, but it didn't hurt until an hour or so later.
TrainSen	00010	 It just sucked that it was on my face.
TrainSen	00010	 It made me nervous when I heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because I had been putting it on for many days.
TrainSen	00010	 Thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm.
TrainSen	00010	 I spend much time alone now that I moved away.
TrainSen	00010	 Luckily I enjoy being by myself.
TrainSen	00010	 It is nice to have the peace and quiet.
TrainSen	00010	 The parties are fun, it is just that I would prefer to chill with just my friends, not a million people that I don't know.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know too much about bull fighting, most other sports I have played.
TrainSen	00010	 I do not see the glamour, passion, and joy of bullfighting.
TrainSen	01000	the weekend was nice.
TrainSen	01000	 an old family friend came up to visit.
TrainSen	01000	 I've known him since 3rd grade I think? something like that.
TrainSen	01000	 bowling.
TrainSen	01000	 Bumming around.
TrainSen	01000	 Gaming.
TrainSen	01000	 pool.
TrainSen	01000	 Eating.
TrainSen	01000	 Etc etc.
TrainSen	01000	 Was fun.
TrainSen	01000	 now back to class after a long weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 ugh.
TrainSen	01000	 These classes aren't very interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 But that's ok.
TrainSen	01000	 it's just basic sequence right now.
TrainSen	01000	 once I start taking major sequence classes.
TrainSen	01000	 I think it will become more interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 these classes just seem like a hassle.
TrainSen	01000	 I never liked writing assignments.
TrainSen	01000	 Mostly because I've never been a strong writer.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not very skilled at thinking of what to write.
TrainSen	01000	 words never seem to flow.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know.
TrainSen	01000	 I really wonder what I'll do with my life.
TrainSen	01000	 biomedical engineering sounds all fancy and stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 But will it really provide me with a decent life in the future? I really don't know.
TrainSen	01000	 it doesn't seem like there's much flexibility with this major.
TrainSen	01000	 I do take cem, phys, bio courses and stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 So it seems like my work covers over areas from different majors.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I'll have a wide variety of knowledge.
TrainSen	01000	 But I won't be an expert in any of the areas.
TrainSen	01000	 plus with competition from foreign sources.
TrainSen	01000	 The future scares me even more.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I do get somewhat bitter when I think about how researchers may earn something like 40-50K a year.
TrainSen	01000	 But then the MBA that hired them gets 100+ perhaps? that's just bs.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't think it's very fair at all.
TrainSen	01000	 But nothing's ever very fair.
TrainSen	01000	 man.
TrainSen	01000	 I really want a job.
TrainSen	01000	 I have time I guess.
TrainSen	01000	 But no transportation.
TrainSen	01000	 and then not all the jobs I've looked through were at the right times.
TrainSen	01000	 I applied for something at the LAN cave in jester.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I get that.
TrainSen	01000	 then I need to start looking for scholarships.
TrainSen	01000	 Internships.
TrainSen	01000	 Summer research.
TrainSen	01000	 Etc etc etc.
TrainSen	01000	 oh yeah.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to look for an apartment for next year.
TrainSen	01000	 I really don't want to end up in the dorms again.
TrainSen	01000	 as much as I like the fast internet.
TrainSen	01000	 I really want a room of my own.
TrainSen	01000	 And the freedom that comes with living in a place of your own.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess it is pretty free in the dorms.
TrainSen	01000	 But I can't blast the music when I want to.
TrainSen	01000	 Or turn up the volumes for gaming.
TrainSen	01000	 besides.
TrainSen	01000	 Blanton isn't really the best dorm out there either.
TrainSen	01000	 not having a sink in the room really sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 it's not a big deal to walk to the bathroom.
TrainSen	01000	 But for stuff like making ramen.
TrainSen	01000	 A quick wash of the face.
TrainSen	01000	 Or maybe just a drink of cool water.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to make a trip.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I'm just lazy.
TrainSen	01000	 But it's odd that some dorms have sinks in the room and others don't.
TrainSen	01000	 only ten minutes have passed.
TrainSen	01000	 Feels like a lot more than that.
TrainSen	01000	 time passes slowly when you're not having much fun.
TrainSen	01000	 I like seeing things animated.
TrainSen	01000	 Or in motion.
TrainSen	01000	 sitting and writing.
TrainSen	01000	 Or reading.
TrainSen	01000	 They're not that interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 I do like reading about computer technology and astronomy and cars and stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 But it's hard to make myself sit down and read a book like harry potter.
TrainSen	01000	 I haven't done that in years.
TrainSen	01000	 yeah.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't think I've willingly read a fiction book since middle school.
TrainSen	01000	 I remember those redwall and mossflower books.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess they were the trend back in the day.
TrainSen	01000	 I signed up for the 3rd coast gaming competition later this month.
TrainSen	01000	 aiya.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm a bit worried.
TrainSen	01000	 playing at the arcades isn't like playing on a console.
TrainSen	01000	 the controls feel different.
TrainSen	01000	 plus.
TrainSen	01000	 When I play at the arcades.
TrainSen	01000	 I get beaten a lot.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess it kind of hurts my confidence.
TrainSen	01000	 But that's ok.
TrainSen	01000	 I'll just see how I match up with the other people in the competition.
TrainSen	01000	 besides.
TrainSen	01000	 It's only $10.
TrainSen	01000	 And I think it'll be fun to watch the l337 play.
TrainSen	01000	 I could really go for a huge huge glass of orange juice right now.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe some pluckers wings too.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know.
TrainSen	01000	 What should I write about.
TrainSen	01000	 ""anything at all"".
TrainSen	01000	 it's so vague.
TrainSen	01000	 I like having a little more of an idea of what I'm doing.
TrainSen	01000	 *shrug*.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 don't use this as a cry for help huh.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't really cry out for help.
TrainSen	01000	 well.
TrainSen	01000	 Not in very noticeable ways.
TrainSen	01000	 keeping secrets hurts you huh.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I've probably shortened my life a lot then.
TrainSen	01000	 aiya.
TrainSen	01000	 Being Asian.
TrainSen	01000	 That's my excuse.
TrainSen	01000	 the guy isn't really supposed to show weakness.
TrainSen	01000	 Heh.
TrainSen	01000	 What a stupid way of thinking.
TrainSen	01000	 But after 18 years.
TrainSen	01000	 It's hard to break the habit.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how people can be so carefree.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope the year goes well.
TrainSen	01000	 I really do.
TrainSen	01000	 Too much tension everywhere.
TrainSen	01000	 I really just want to break lose and forget all the responsibilities I have.
TrainSen	01000	 But I don't think I can.
TrainSen	01000	 it's just not something I'd do.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm tired.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to find something.
TrainSen	01000	 Someone amazing.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't want to just cruise through life.
TrainSen	00100	Well I am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day, all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it's really quiet in here, which is actually really nice considering I hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 Too bad that I have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study I will be leading for kappa that I have little time to rest I really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because I have so much going on that I feel guilty if I am not always being productive.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that I need to take time every day just to sit with God and tell him what is going on in my mind.
TrainSen	00100	 So that's what I want to do with this exercise I am going to type everything I think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to God.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate that I feel like I constantly need to be watching my money, or what I eat, or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like I am making wise decisions, why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups? I know I human, and that I am sinful and that I can't do anything on my own.
TrainSen	00100	 So I don't know why I get disappointed in my failures, why should I expect anything else??? I feel pretty guilty about how much time I put into some of my relationships as well, like I wish I was there for Lauren F.
TrainSen	00100	 more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable.
TrainSen	00100	 Please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her.
TrainSen	00100	 I also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life, I need you to make me aware of when I start to count calories (eaten or burnt!) or when I start to keep a constant tab on how much I spend or what people owe me.
TrainSen	00100	 Lord I want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something I deserve because I know that I do not!   I also know that I need to take a nap this afternoon if I want to get any work done later so I pray that I would be able to do that as well.
TrainSen	00100	 I have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what's important.
TrainSen	00100	 YOU and my family and friends and everyone else in my life.
TrainSen	00100	 Lord I want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel really excited about this year but it's discouraging when I can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 I really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment, but what can you do!  I hate that I was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they're having communicating, I am also so worried about David, MP, and Nancy, I just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you Lord, and understand your love for them.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I knew what to expect on this PHL test coming up on Thursday, but there I go again with wanting to know things before the right timing.
TrainSen	00100	 I am worried that I am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as I should be but I know that I am doing the best I can and they shouldn't be consuming my life.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so glad I got to spend time with ford this weekend and I really hope that he doesn't have a flight delay because of the rain here and in Atlanta because I know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back.
TrainSen	00100	 But I know he was supposed to be here this weekend and I am so glad that he got to talk to Chris last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason I am really upset that the tuna fish I bought and that 7up drink turned out to be busts, because that cost what, maybe $4???? come on Louise you are so cheap get over it!!! surprisingly I am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but I know that I need to be really giving that to you and I really hope it doesn't all hit me at once tomorrow.
TrainSen	00100	 I am really hot so I had to go turn on the fan.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder when becca and Martha are getting back, is it wrong that I kind of like that they aren't around right now? Why is it that I like to be alone so much, is it selfishness??? I am kind of worried about Kyle maybe liking me, I really don't want him to, because I really love having him as a friend and I really don't know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason I've been getting that vibe lately so I really hope that I can act in a way that doesn't lead him on but that is still nice.
TrainSen	00100	 Man that 7up stuff I got is disgusting!!! why do I always try those things.
TrainSen	00100	 Healthy soft drinks?!?! what a joke!!! of course it's going to taste awful.
TrainSen	00100	 I really hate that I am always feeling like I need to be repaid when I do something for someone I mean seriously! why can't I just give out of love and show like grace like Christ did to us??? I am really excited about this PSYCH class though because it'll be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 12 hours of sleep I got on Saturday I really need to get rest because I know I don't get nearly enough, help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you didn't make us require so much sleep for nothing! I just wish I would enjoy it I pray that I could have a peace so that I could sleep right now.
TrainSen	10000	     last night I laid down and I Couldn't go to sleep for anything.
TrainSen	10000	 sleep would be nice right now, I have class all day today.
TrainSen	10000	 my classes are pretty cool though.
TrainSen	10000	 I have music psychology and ceramics.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm good at ceramics though cause I got grounded a lot in high school.
TrainSen	10000	 high school was fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a lot of great memories.
TrainSen	10000	 I miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are.
TrainSen	10000	 I am finally realizing the value of that too.
TrainSen	10000	 I think its the art .
TrainSen	10000	 I love art its constantly running thorough my head.
TrainSen	10000	 The way I look at everything, the way I find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way I am so attracted to things that are gorgeous.
TrainSen	10000	 not only on the outside but personalities for example and music.
TrainSen	10000	 I am going to incubus on Wednesday and they are brilliant.
TrainSen	10000	 its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways.
TrainSen	10000	 my music class meets too often .
TrainSen	10000	 4 days a week.
TrainSen	10000	 that shit is ridiculous.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel like I am taking 15 hours but I'm just taking 12, which allows for a job.
TrainSen	10000	 I am going to work at the frank Erwin center hopefully .
TrainSen	10000	 I was a waitress this summer at el Chico.
TrainSen	10000	 I love Mexican food.
TrainSen	10000	 I am so damn hungry right now.
TrainSen	10000	 oops can I cuss? oh well.
TrainSen	10000	 my stomach is rumbling and I felt it necessary.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me.
TrainSen	10000	 lately I've been dead set on being responsible and I am hell bent on making all A's , so when I can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke.
TrainSen	10000	 my back hurts so bad every day from stress.
TrainSen	10000	 its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because I was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc.
TrainSen	10000	 and I could not get over a dinky little cold for 3 weeks, and now that I've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier.
TrainSen	10000	 its so much easier just being a sophomore in general.
TrainSen	10000	 I remember when I moved into the dorms my freshmen year.
TrainSen	10000	 we moved everything in and I remember after my dad left standing there looking around.
TrainSen	10000	 I had no phone, no friends, and no clue and I think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life.
TrainSen	10000	 but when I look back I have learned that you can't always know everything at that second.
TrainSen	10000	 you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all.
TrainSen	10000	 what is this an autobiography? I don't know I am just writing as I go along.
TrainSen	10000	 I like to write.
TrainSen	10000	 I write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about.
TrainSen	10000	 I like to vent, I NEED to vent.
TrainSen	10000	 its almost like when I write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know maybe I'm weird.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so I do poetry as well.
TrainSen	10000	 but I am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another.
TrainSen	10000	 how about love? I am in love.
TrainSen	10000	 I am not quick to say that either and it is not something I was trying to do or even wanted, but I have found  my soul mate believe  it or not.
TrainSen	10000	 he is perfect, and believe me I am not naive.
TrainSen	10000	 he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the ADHD ) and I love his mind because I appreciate things I cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me.
TrainSen	10000	 really all I want is to be fascinated, and to laugh.
TrainSen	10000	 I love to laugh.
TrainSen	10000	 you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry.
TrainSen	10000	 man that's the best.
TrainSen	10000	 seriously.
TrainSen	10000	 that's why I like to surround myself with people who make me laugh.
TrainSen	10000	 I make myself laugh too.
TrainSen	10000	 I am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts.
TrainSen	10000	 or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks.
TrainSen	10000	 I love that.
TrainSen	00001	     Right now I am doing this psychology ut what will I be doing in the next couple seconds.
TrainSen	00001	 Oop, my roommate just walked in and I have to talk to him and do this stream of consciousness writing at the same time.
TrainSen	00001	 Hard! My room mate said hi and I am having trouble responding to him, it looks like Stephanie is impressed with my bass.
TrainSen	00001	 All right you all have a good one.
TrainSen	00001	 Roommate has left, that is weird.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what Misung shin  yeah interesting ats salivate when they win him and Stephanie are going to do together, probably nothing much, I can hear my roommate, err my people across the way talking about something they usually play madden 2005 until the wee hours of the morning which doesn't really bother me but I think it might a little, who knows its probably just something to complain about.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to go out to dinner tonight and was thinking about going with David but I don't have his number so maybe ill call mom and  dad to find out his number oh man that paper reminds me, I got to do the psychology experiment before Saturday I don't really understand the experiment system but I think it is explained somewhere in this syllabus well I have been going on for a while now and I still have a ways to go, phooey.
TrainSen	00001	 I like my psych teacher though, he can somehow make the things we talk about in class not only funny but very interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 oh man I think I accidentally typed some words in the wrong spot oh well I'll just keep going so yeah my psych teacher is good, and this intro class is very interesting makes you want to learn more about neurology I was thinking about how he really knows his stuff and if I could ever be  a professor who really really knew his stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 Do I work hard enough? I think I do, I been taken it easy this week just chilling in my room but I've been working too.
TrainSen	00001	 Another thing that I can't escape thinking bout right now is girls it the subject on every young mans mind, yet maybe I think about it more than others.
TrainSen	00001	 I think about whether or not I'm too picky.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't ever gone with a girl for longer than like 2 months I really can't stand the thought of a girlfriend, I haven't really met a girl that I'm really interested in even though in these first few weeks I've already had some opportunities but I just straight decided I didn't' want to go with them why? you know it has to do with looks I probably seem really shallow but I just want a chick who looks DAMN good not just good if I find myself thinking of reasons why I don't like you the fact of the matter is I'm going g to ditch and better sooner than late I've ditched some really cool people and I feel bad about it but then I've been ditched too sometimes I think I have too many friends but the fact of the matter is if you don't want to be somebody's best friend eventually your just not going to hang out anymore so I need courage the courage to approach a girl and ask her out on a date, don't worry about if its going to be a good date just go for it and get rejected damnit that's what I say get rejected and feel that pain because one of these days your going to ask her she's going to say yes and then its just going to work these things don't just fall into your lap out of the blue at the least you have to keep yourself open to other people always meet new people I think I will ask Kim and Liz if they want to go out sometime now there's two people that look like they got their shit together Liz dropped out of sfa last year so what? she has her priorities straight you know everybody has their faults I don't want to be recognized for getting a's in class that's crap I want people to say yeah that guys is a friggin funny cool guy I like being around him, but I only want people that I can get along with to say that how do you tell the ones that like you but you don't like them gto go away it seems harsh you don't want to be an ass and the fact of the matter is you may need them some day but for what??? as long as you've got your friends you are unstoppable you are having fun you are just with your buddies and you wouldn't have it any other way like my family man I just realized how much I love them by being away from them for such an extended period of time I really missed them I didn't think that would happen but it did my sister my dad my mom are really important to me and I love them to death bottom line man I'm hungry after this I'm going to see if I can get a hold of David and singer and maybe well go get something to eat I got to talk to David man that guy is really cool maybe I have the number in my desk somewhere I don't know but maybe ill just be lazy and go out by myself, maybe just maybe ill go out an meet somebody that will play an important role in my life maybe ill have one of the best times of my freshman year who knows what could happen in the 20 minutes after I finish this project who knows?  God knows? don't get me started I could write all the proofs that straight out blast Christianity to the nether regions but no I believe in that little piece of spirituality that's in us all call it God Jesus whatever its there but it is just there its our spirituality it is us so thanks for reading and ill talk to you later boi.
TrainSen	10000	     this is the weirdest thing I have ever had to-do.
TrainSen	10000	 right now my roommate is watching the graham Norton effect and it is hard to concentrate.
TrainSen	10000	 the show is really funny.
TrainSen	10000	 he just changed the channel I am going to ask if could turn it down a little.
TrainSen	10000	 Yesterday I had a really good date.
TrainSen	10000	 it is all I can think about today.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope things turn out good because I don't want to be hurt.
TrainSen	10000	 I went to the gym today.
TrainSen	10000	 I like and dislike working out.
TrainSen	10000	 I like the end result and the feeling after working out, but I hate the feeling before I have start working out.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to go out tonight.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't have class on Fridays so I feel obligated to go out and do something.
TrainSen	10000	 I got some people to go salsa dancing.
TrainSen	10000	 nobody has really confirmed f they're going or not.
TrainSen	10000	 I kind don't want to go anymore, but since some people already said yes I have to go.
TrainSen	10000	 I am sure I will have tonight.
TrainSen	10000	 this is really strange.
TrainSen	10000	 I am just spilling out random thoughts.
TrainSen	10000	 I really like the guy I went on date with.
TrainSen	10000	 Well I don't know if I like him or if I like the idea of being with him? I guess time will show.
TrainSen	10000	 I am tired of being single.
TrainSen	10000	 I want a boyfriend! I was at the gym and I felt for some reason really aroused.
TrainSen	10000	 I usually don't get aroused at the gym but today I saw a really hot guy that I couldn't get out of my head.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if that is  BAD THING to like a guy but still be really turned on by other guys.
TrainSen	10000	 I know it is perfectly normal but I would have tired something with this guy if he had asked me to.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe that's why people think I am whore.
TrainSen	10000	 I m really sexual.
TrainSen	10000	 I am really worried about getting in the communication school.
TrainSen	10000	 I think about everyday.
TrainSen	10000	 if I don't get in I don't know what I will do if I don't get in.
TrainSen	10000	 I just had dinner by myself.
TrainSen	10000	 I hate eating by myself.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it is because I had no friends when I was growing up.
TrainSen	10000	 I have friends now but tend to want them around to much.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to have sex I hope ya'll don't read this because are going to think the worst of me, but at the same time I don't what anybody thinks of me.
TrainSen	10000	 for the most part.
TrainSen	10000	 I keep looking at the clock to see how much time I have left.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I am doing this right because if I am not than I will be really mad.
TrainSen	10000	 my is cool but he tends to be an ass sometimes.
TrainSen	10000	 he was just over my shoulder reading this.
TrainSen	10000	 I told him not too and then he stop.
TrainSen	10000	 he is watching Seinfeld now I wish I could enjoy the show right now.
TrainSen	10000	 Wait no he is watching the king of queens.
TrainSen	10000	 my mistake.
TrainSen	10000	 I can concentrate now because I don't like that show.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a lot of pretty friends.
TrainSen	00100	I have realized that my computer at home is a lot slower than my cool computer at school.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my computer at school, but at least this one does not have annoying pop-ups like that one.
TrainSen	00100	 Ah! I am angry at Christina for downloading a stupid program onto my computer that had hidden programs.
TrainSen	00100	 I am at home right now and I am happy, I miss being able to shower without shower shoes on.
TrainSen	00100	 Everything is a lot more clean too, at least that is how I feel.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that that's just because I am used to home.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh my god my typing skills have deteriorated I think so have my spelling skills my head itches and I just washed my hair so now its dripping all over my shirt, because I am too lazy to blow dry my hair.
TrainSen	00100	 speaking of which I need to bring my blow dryer to school so I don't sleep with wet hair because that gives me headaches.
TrainSen	00100	 Today on the bus back home I was feeling nauseous hmm I do not think I spelled that right because I was reading my psychology reading hehe that's what I'm writing this essay for anyways I was feeling like I you know having to capitalize all the It's is very annoying and my weird keyboard is not helping very much either o yah so I decided to take a nap so I would not throw up.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my house.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope tomorrow I will be able to hang out with my old friends who are still at home! many of them have left already except the ones going to west coast schools.
TrainSen	00100	 lucky people they are, except they will still be in school in June when all of us are out! I told daddy about the Normandy scholar program that I was interested in, but I knew that he was not going to let me go or really try to apply.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that my parents are way to protective of me sometimes, but I know it is for my own good because oh! I might get in some accident over there and they will not be able to help me, but seriously, if I get into a really bad accident there should be people in Europe who would help me by the way the Normandy scholar program is this thing where part of it you spend three weeks in Europe going to old world war II sites and you learn about world war II, which I think is interesting partially because I seem to be weirdly interested in wars and stuff, maybe that's why I like Ender's Game so much.
TrainSen	00100	 but I also like band of brothers! which got me interested in world war II in the first place! and my favorite movie is black hawk down which is also kind of about a war, but more like a battle.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm thinking about bringing my DVD's to school, but one they might not fit into my tiny suitcase and two they might distract me because I'll want to watch them instead of studying, like how my roommate and I stayed up until 2:30 for the past 2 nights watching Chinese soap operas.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it's really funny because I am not really into girly stuff and the acting is so bad in these dramas but they sort of just suck you in and you have to finish watching them, like when you watch anime, speaking of which I need to see if the next Full Metal Alchemist episode is out or maybe I will just borrow it from my buddy.
TrainSen	00100	 She's crazy but I like how she is protective of me.
TrainSen	00100	 So I know that I hopefully won't get into any scary trouble! hehe it's like, now that I am away from my family at least I have someone I can trust to be there for me most of the time.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope.
TrainSen	00100	 I think.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe not that much.
TrainSen	00100	 yea my hair is getting dry and now I have a piece of hair on my hand.
TrainSen	00100	 I seem to be shedding a lot but I think that is normal because everyone else I have talked to say that it happens to them too.
TrainSen	00100	 I just don't like how every time I wash my hair big wads of hair come out.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like I'm going bald, except I still have tons of hair, which makes me wonder how do I still have this much hair yet lose so much hair every time I wash my hair.
TrainSen	00100	 because it takes a while for new hairs to grow as long as the old ones right? I wonder how much hair do we really have on our heads.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my sister and her friends this summer was really fun.
TrainSen	00100	 even though I was only in California for about a week I really felt like I belonged there.
TrainSen	00100	 It just seems so hard to go out and meet new people.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I'm too shy around strangers.
TrainSen	00100	 If I acted like myself when I'm with friends around people I don't know maybe it will be easier to make new friends.
TrainSen	00100	 but I am afraid that eek I think I feel that I have a headache coming on.
TrainSen	00100	 but I feel that I'll scare people away.
TrainSen	00100	 But I mean if I'm going to be their friend they will eventually find out that that's the way I am right? I guess yay only about three more minutes to go.
TrainSen	00100	 I think  my contacts are getting kind of foggy.
TrainSen	00100	 I should blink more.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder do hard contacts yah they do but I think they get more dry quicker than soft contacts.
TrainSen	00100	 I think they might be dirty but wouldn't that make my eyes hurt? maybe I don't know I always cringe when they fall into the sink! ew so gross.
TrainSen	00100	 and to think that I'm putting these into my eyes everyday! I forgot to bring my sucker thing home just incase my contacts got stuck in my eyes.
TrainSen	00100	 But I guess it's okay because I hope guess think they won't get stuck.
TrainSen	00100	 so I didn't really forget I just say I did.
TrainSen	00100	 it's kind of like I'm like a pathological liar then? I don't know it's just easier to say things and not have to explain them because then people get bored and are like ""why are you telling me this"" so I just lie to make it easier.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if that's bad? like I remember the time that my friend called me really late at night and wanted to talk for no apparent reason.
TrainSen	00010	Ok, it's labor day.
TrainSen	00010	 What a great day.
TrainSen	00010	 Good thing because I needed to do a lot of homework.
TrainSen	00010	 Geez, calculus is so easy but they give us too much homework.
TrainSen	00010	 That baja place really sucked.
TrainSen	00010	 That's not Mexican food at all!  It was way too expensive for the way it tasted.
TrainSen	00010	 That dog commercial was funny!  I have been eating too much Domino's Pizza lately.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm going to lose all my muscle and just get fat if I keep it up.
TrainSen	00010	 Halo was awesome last night.
TrainSen	00010	 3 Hours for one mission!  That's crazy.
TrainSen	00010	 But it was so much fun.
TrainSen	00010	 That girl I met is so cool.
TrainSen	00010	 She's different, and I like that.
TrainSen	00010	 Hmm, if I try too hard she won't like that and she'll get scared off.
TrainSen	00010	 If I don't try at all she'll think I don't like her.
TrainSen	00010	 Girls are so freaking confusing.
TrainSen	00010	 That chick had a guys name.
TrainSen	00010	 Mr.
TrainSen	00010	 Pennebaker is pretty cool and funny.
TrainSen	00010	 I thought it was going to suck at first.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh my god that psychology book is starting to get really hard to read.
TrainSen	00010	 The next chapter talks about all the parts of the brain and I don't think my brain will be able to remember all that stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if that puppy turns girls off?  Hmm oh well if they don't like it I don't care.
TrainSen	00010	 I should get more water because its starting to run out.
TrainSen	00010	 Is weed really that bad?  Hmm,  why do so many people do it?  I don't know but I don't think it's that bad.
TrainSen	00010	 Alcohol is probably worst and that's legal.
TrainSen	00010	 My hand is starting to hurt and it's only been like 6 minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss my car.
TrainSen	00010	 It was so freaking fast.
TrainSen	00010	 Going 125 on the highway was freedom.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I'm really stressed out and don't know how to relieve it.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to play halo again.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm going to try to call her again in like an hour.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope she isn't too busy.
TrainSen	00010	 Man I should just wait for her to call me,  what if she starts hating me for trying too hard.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to eat McDonalds later on.
TrainSen	00010	 And some ice-cream.
TrainSen	00010	 Damn, then I have to go run for an hour.
TrainSen	00010	 Why am I starting to hate that.
TrainSen	00010	 It used to be my favorite thing to do.
TrainSen	00010	 Well probably because there are so many better things to do here.
TrainSen	00010	 Church was ok.
TrainSen	00010	 The singing and piano were freaking awesome!  It was a little boring though.
TrainSen	00010	 Mass in Spanish is better for me.
TrainSen	00010	 I have to go look for one soon.
TrainSen	00010	 That'll be better.
TrainSen	00010	 If god doesn't exist that would suck.
TrainSen	00010	 That means when we die we just die.
TrainSen	00010	 We can't dream anymore, we can't think, or do anything.
TrainSen	00010	 We just don't exist.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't even imagine that.
TrainSen	00010	 Because when I am sleeping I am still thinking.
TrainSen	00010	 What would it feel like to no longer be in existence?  Well you wouldn't really feel anything.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm answering a lot of my own questions.
TrainSen	00010	 Why does Pennebaker want us to do this.
TrainSen	00010	 He has his professional degree.
TrainSen	00010	 He must be pretty damn smart.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe he is studying us every time we go into his class.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss my dog.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope he is in doggy heaven now.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate cats, why don't they like me.
TrainSen	00010	 Hey it's Robert,  I'm going to go answer the door.
TrainSen	00010	 Ok lets turn on the TV.
TrainSen	00010	 Only 8 minutes left.
TrainSen	00010	 pp pp shee pp pp shee.
TrainSen	00010	 He's busting a beat it sounds pretty good.
TrainSen	00010	 I like coke better than Pepsi.
TrainSen	00010	 How can anybody not like Adam sander.
TrainSen	00010	 He is so funny and so is that guy on that god movie.
TrainSen	00010	 what was it called.
TrainSen	00010	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00010	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh yeah Bruce almighty.
TrainSen	00010	 what was his name.
TrainSen	00010	 Ace Ventura no that isn't it.
TrainSen	00010	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh Yeah JIM  Carrey.
TrainSen	00010	 he is funny too.
TrainSen	00010	 Old but funny.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow will smith looks good for him being so old and all.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to keep looking that young when I get old.
TrainSen	00010	 Music is awesome.
TrainSen	00010	 I've learned so much about what I like since I've gotten here.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I'm going to learn a lot about myself in this college.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm glad I got accepted.
TrainSen	00010	 Actually I like that I got that full scholarship.
TrainSen	00010	 Man mad TV is funny.
TrainSen	00010	 they are really good actors.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope people don't think they are losers because it is really hard to keep a straight face and act so well.
TrainSen	00010	 We are going to go eat again.
TrainSen	00010	 Yummy!  I hope it is like a burger place or something.
TrainSen	00010	 Kinsolving food is pretty good.
TrainSen	00010	 The people there are also really  nice.
TrainSen	00010	 That black guy is hilarious.
TrainSen	00010	 He is really friendly too.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder when I have to take that test for the business school.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I failed it the last time I took it.
TrainSen	00010	 GOD she is so pretty.
TrainSen	00010	 Both of them.
TrainSen	00010	 Why are girls like that.
TrainSen	00010	 Why do they lead you on.
TrainSen	00010	 Even now she is leading me on.
TrainSen	00010	 Is the new girl my girlfriend now?  We do everything that couples do.
TrainSen	00010	 we go out in public together and everyone has seen us.
TrainSen	00010	 Does that make us an Item?  Maybe.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not sure if I want a girlfriend here in college.
TrainSen	00010	 But the companionship of a female is really good.
TrainSen	00010	 Having a good girlfriend is hard to find.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope that girl I met last week will be good friends with me.
TrainSen	00010	 I can learn so much from her.
TrainSen	00010	 But she is too attractive and it'll be really hard for me to just be friends with her.
TrainSen	00010	 I've already kissed her.
TrainSen	00010	 She let me, so what does that mean?  Maybe just friends that think they are attractive.
TrainSen	00010	 She probably did mean that she doesn't want a boyfriend.
TrainSen	00010	 Well girls are so confusing.
TrainSen	00010	 20 minutes up, time to go eat.
TrainSen	10000	     This summer has been such a burden on me.
TrainSen	10000	 I am dwelling in it and it is eating me up.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know why exactly we broke up I just know that it was completely out of place and unexpected.
TrainSen	10000	 I find myself digging myself deeper and deeper into it and not really caring what it is doing to me.
TrainSen	10000	 I just can't seem to let it go.
TrainSen	10000	 It might be because we were together for so long and go so close.
TrainSen	10000	 She was the best person God had ever put in my life.
TrainSen	10000	 We seemed to click, it seemed so perfect, and she told me she felt the same.
TrainSen	10000	 She told me a couple weeks before she left me that this being her longest relationship was starting to trigger her flight reflexes.
TrainSen	10000	 She was scared.
TrainSen	10000	 She told me I meant to much to her and that the relationship meant to me to her.
TrainSen	10000	 She had just come to terms with the fact that she was in love with me.
TrainSen	10000	 Something she hadn't let herself do with anyone else before me.
TrainSen	10000	 It felt so right.
TrainSen	10000	 I was at such a high, life was so good.
TrainSen	10000	 I was happier than I had ever been.
TrainSen	10000	 I became so dependant on her for happiness.
TrainSen	10000	 I know that is something that was unhealthy, but she had gotten just as dependant on me.
TrainSen	10000	 We had so many plans for the future.
TrainSen	10000	 We planned out every step of the way.
TrainSen	10000	 Factoring in everything including my going off to college and her finishing up her last year in high school.
TrainSen	10000	 Everyone is telling me to move on, but she told me before she left that if anything ever happened between us, for me not to let her go.
TrainSen	10000	 She wanted to get through this hell or high water.
TrainSen	10000	 Nothing was going to tear us apart.
TrainSen	10000	 During the summer we got closer than ever.
TrainSen	10000	 We had many plans for the summer.
TrainSen	10000	 We bought tickets to concerts.
TrainSen	10000	 Then she went off to camp.
TrainSen	10000	 She said nothing was going to happen at camp.
TrainSen	10000	 Four days into it she calls me and tells me that she can no longer be with me.
TrainSen	10000	 What the hell happened at camp.
TrainSen	10000	 I go to Warped tour and she with someone else.
TrainSen	10000	 All I can do is give her a hug and say ""Nice pick over 6 feet tall and blonde, just like I said.
TrainSen	10000	 "" Seeing as I was joking around with her a few weeks before saying that she would leave me for someone of that exact same description.
TrainSen	10000	 Later she calls me and tells me it wasn't what it looked like.
TrainSen	10000	 I blew up on her.
TrainSen	10000	 It was a normal reaction.
TrainSen	10000	 Everything she said before camp got my hopes soaring, and then BANG, everything comes crashing down.
TrainSen	10000	 Everyone tells me that she probably found someone up there.
TrainSen	10000	 And I completely defended her.
TrainSen	10000	 Cause I knew her better than anyone else, not only my thoughts but hers as well.
TrainSen	10000	 She was just afraid of commitment because she had been hurt so much in the past.
TrainSen	10000	 Every male figure in her past had let her down, and she couldn't comprehend someone loving her as much as I did.
TrainSen	10000	 So because all the idiots in her past, I have to be let go because she can't handle commitment even after all the time we spent together.
TrainSen	10000	 Why did she have to go, we were happy.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know what happened at camp.
TrainSen	10000	 It was more than seven weeks ago that I talked to her.
TrainSen	10000	 I called this week and left a message she didn't return.
TrainSen	10000	 I called again today.
TrainSen	10000	 She picked up we talked for 18 minutes and 36 seconds.
TrainSen	10000	 She seems perfectly happy, just as free as a freaking butterfly, not caring at all, it seems, about what I am feeling.
TrainSen	10000	 How is it that she can be so freaking happy being alone and I'm sitting hear eating myself up and being miserable.
TrainSen	10000	 Is everything that has happened a game to her.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't understand how I can move past this.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't what to do.
TrainSen	10000	 I gave her everything.
TrainSen	10000	 And it feels impossible to get it back.
TrainSen	10000	 I still love her more than I love anyone, including myself.
TrainSen	10000	 All I can do is sit and write songs about it.
TrainSen	00100	     It is interesting to note that when I work on something in my head, I always forget what the details were unless I write it down.
TrainSen	00100	 One thing I do remember though, are the feelings.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like what I had though was a great accomplishment that should have been written down to further my learning ability, particularly in math.
TrainSen	00100	 With this I acn create a continuation, or a stream of consciousness type format within my math knowledge.
TrainSen	00100	 This would help me learn a lot more on my own, rather than starting over as much as I do on particular problems.
TrainSen	00100	 The only problem is I do not know how to keep a good organized notebook, rather I havjust not done it yet.
TrainSen	00100	 I can keep things very well organized when I want t, but finding the motivation to do this , that is a hard thing to do.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I could find a way to ake a lot of things easier.
TrainSen	00100	 Speaking of which, I always make things easier in math.
TrainSen	00100	 I always say that I am so good at some things because I make those things much easier than most people make them.
TrainSen	00100	 I do this because I am lazy.
TrainSen	00100	 Simply put, I work on something to make it easier for me in the future.
TrainSen	00100	 Ultimately I get easier work tat way, so I am a lazy, yet slightly thoughtful person.
TrainSen	00100	 Thoughtful in the way of thinking, not as in the consideration of others.
TrainSen	00100	 Well my roommate walked in the room, so my stream of consciousness is screwed.
TrainSen	00100	 So hi!! Well, anyways what was I talking about?stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 Ohhhh my laziness.
TrainSen	00100	 That's a long subject.
TrainSen	00100	 I am very lazy, but I really need to work on my laziness.
TrainSen	00100	 I am trying to do this, my mental laziness is not very bad, but physically I don't do as much as  I like.
TrainSen	00100	 So, I guess signing up for intramural sports was a good thing.
TrainSen	00100	 I am going to try flag football this semester.
TrainSen	00100	 and I REALLY want to play ping-pong (a.
TrainSen	00100	 k.
TrainSen	00100	 A.
TrainSen	00100	 table tennis, as I  should probably start calling it).
TrainSen	00100	 I was a little.
TrainSen	00100	 Ok very.
TrainSen	00100	 upset when I lost so many times the other day, I don't normally play as bad as I did that night.
TrainSen	00100	 I just used a contraction, I was told not to use those in formal apers so I try not to ever use them in any type of written assignment, or even when talking o frieds, apparently I did not follow through with that a few moments ago.
TrainSen	00100	 Well, other than that I am kind of at a loss on what to write.
TrainSen	00100	 I am very hungry now, probably has something to do with the food I am smelling.
TrainSen	00100	 I wishi could gain some weight.
TrainSen	00100	 Which reminds me, I used to go around saying how much I wanted to be fat, but I quit saying that when some friends of mine told me how much that they did not like me saying that.
TrainSen	00100	 My hands are getting tired and my mind is starting to sleep.
TrainSen	00100	 My eyes are shutting too.
TrainSen	00100	 Not good when I have 8 minutes and 16 seconds left.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well .
TrainSen	00100	 I want to go eat now.
TrainSen	00100	 I have a lot of homework tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 I won't get to do anything fun, I won't ever get to do anything fun on the weekdays, I may have taken too many hours, but then again is college supposed to be asy???? No its not.
TrainSen	00100	 ( I used that contraction again).
TrainSen	00100	 .
TrainSen	00100	 And I forgot the apostrophe, haha.
TrainSen	00100	 Anyways college is supposed to be hard.
TrainSen	00100	 So, I should probably enjoy working on homework 6 horus a day, catching up on the weekends while I do laundry, and then on the weekend nights I get time to play ping pong and be with other Dean's Scholars people and play intramural football with them.
TrainSen	00100	 Speaking of which I played ultimate frisbee the other day.
TrainSen	00100	 Err I mean yesterday.
TrainSen	00100	 It was great, It was good to have some more physical activity in my life.
TrainSen	00100	 I scare myself cause my abs.
TrainSen	00100	 Well, where I should have abs at least.
TrainSen	00100	 Still hurt from limbo three days ago.
TrainSen	00100	 Also my legs hurt to.
TrainSen	00100	 My roommate just said scrotum.
TrainSen	00100	 I have no idea why.
TrainSen	00100	 Scares me a little more .
TrainSen	00100	 Just thought I would let you know that.
TrainSen	00100	 He is nuts, I guess I should go back to what I was tlaking about earlier.
TrainSen	00100	 Food.
TrainSen	00100	 Haha, I wonder how many words I can type per minute, this would not be a good excercise to try out that theory though, cause if you take an averageit will be a lot lpwer cause I am getting very tired right now, that and I am not punctuating very well, and I am using contractions without the apostrophe's.
TrainSen	00100	 My roommate just reminded me of George Carlin.
TrainSen	00100	 Funny man!!! You should atch his stuff sometime, its hilarious.
TrainSen	00100	 I am talking as if there is someone going to read this.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh, only a minute and a half left.
TrainSen	00100	 My eyes are starting to see some funky shiznit on this screen.
TrainSen	00100	 Man, I am Hungry.
TrainSen	00100	 !!!!! heh, I just looked at the time and it said 19 11, reminded me of 9:11, I see that all the time, or at least I used to on the alarm clock, or any clock for that matter, then I got hurt and it no longer showed up.
TrainSen	01000	     This is kind of new and interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 I have never done my homework like this before.
TrainSen	01000	 I accutally tried to get on the computer to do my prescreening, but the computer isn't loading the page so I thought I might atleast complete my writing assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 Psychology is such an interesting field to study.
TrainSen	01000	 It is my major in fact at this moment.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know if I will change though.
TrainSen	01000	 The reason why I chose psychology as my major is because my family for a large part suffers from bipolar disorder.
TrainSen	01000	 I was always told by my parents, since it is genetic, then one day I will have to face the fact that I will also be afflicted with this disorder.
TrainSen	01000	 With my fate already laid out before me, I thought I might learn more about this disorder and how the brain works in general.
TrainSen	01000	 I never liked the concept that my destiny is laid out before me.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean, yes, genetics do play a certain role in who the person I am, but I don't think it determines everything.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess this is only part of the whole nature-nurture arguement.
TrainSen	01000	 This experiment reminds me of some sort of journal.
TrainSen	01000	 I was thinking about starting a journal and writing down all the interesting experiences I go though in my college carrer.
TrainSen	01000	 I am so lazy though, I know I will fail to write down something one day and one day will turn into two days and then I will probably forget to write in it all together.
TrainSen	01000	 I know it would be beneficial, both psychologically and emotionally if I were to reflect on everyting, but it seems to me the time spent on writing down all my thoughts is more valuable to me than accually having a journal itself.
TrainSen	01000	 A dark haired man just sat near me.
TrainSen	01000	 He didn't sit at the computer directly near me.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder why that is? Does he think I smell? Does he think that I will become offened? Does he find me unapproachable? Or is he just scared of women? I never understood the concept really.
TrainSen	01000	 People tend to perfer to sit with an empty seat between them unless assigned or told to sit next to one another.
TrainSen	01000	 I do the same sometimes, but other times I sit next to the person anyway.
TrainSen	01000	 For instance, I sat next the this guy who had a richy-rich hair cut in my psych.
TrainSen	01000	 class.
TrainSen	01000	 He wasn't very charming.
TrainSen	01000	 That's okay because I wasn't interested in him in that context anyway.
TrainSen	01000	 I tryed to make friendly conversation just for the sake of conversation.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope he didn't think I was hitting on him because I wasn't.
TrainSen	01000	 He really isn't my type.
TrainSen	01000	 He is in the business school.
TrainSen	01000	 Ehh.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean nothing is wrong with that I guess, but people who are business majors should just wear a sign saying 'I want money'.
TrainSen	01000	 Nothing is really wrong with that either because money is good to have, but to focus your life's carrer on that seems kind of mundane.
TrainSen	01000	 I think money is important, but not as important as knowledge, wisdom, and happiness.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess it is because I grew up having absolutely no money.
TrainSen	01000	 People may say they have no money, but really I have no idea how I ate dinner.
TrainSen	01000	 I was that poor.
TrainSen	01000	 I think it is because of this, I tend to value education.
TrainSen	01000	 I look for people who are cultured and knowledgable about soceity.
TrainSen	00001	adrian is rather BORING to talk to.
TrainSen	00001	 I called him first and he didn't even seem the least bit surprised or even thankful.
TrainSen	00001	 nice.
TrainSen	00001	 ""oh abby.
TrainSen	00001	 you're so BEEEYOOOTIFUUUL and so PPEEEERRRRRFECT!!"" I bet he likes the attention he gets from imbuing someone adoration.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe that's the exact reason why I'm attracted to him.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm attracted to the fact that I'm attracted.
TrainSen	00001	 isn't that completely vain?? and shallow too.
TrainSen	00001	 I am ashamed.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe I can't control it.
TrainSen	00001	 it just doesn't happen everyday that someone at least pretends to like you for such exaggeratingly good qualities.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel bored.
TrainSen	00001	 I do not want to read 50 pages of some stuff I can't concentrate on while listening to the TV.
TrainSen	00001	 even if its TV stuff that I don't want to hear.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm listeninng to music.
TrainSen	00001	 finger 11.
TrainSen	00001	 not anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss caleb, jacob, pinky, ed, michelle, michael, mom, dad, janie, cesar, cynthia, everything is SO DIFFERENT from just only 5 years ago.
TrainSen	00001	 we all used to be so close together.
TrainSen	00001	 geographically and familiarly.
TrainSen	00001	 I think this assignment is cool.
TrainSen	00001	 all our writing assignments should be like this.
TrainSen	00001	 the experiment I participated in last week was really boring.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought it would involve something interesting like tasting some product or doing something physical like a handstand and see how gravity affects blowflow to certain body parts.
TrainSen	00001	 THAT would be a cool experiment.
TrainSen	00001	 it could help those poor astronauts and their whatever space effects.
TrainSen	00001	 HUH!! they should be helping poor homeless people off the streets.
TrainSen	00001	 its got to be somehting psychological about that because I mean.
TrainSen	00001	 people could work if there's nothing physical impeding them.
TrainSen	00001	 Hten it must be mental or emotional or ptsd.
TrainSen	00001	 my cousin, michelle, said I almost gave her ptsd.
TrainSen	00001	 post traumatic something disorder.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought that was funny.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I had an awesome sense of humor to make people and myself laugh all the time.
TrainSen	00001	 all I can do is act like my stupid self and that makes people laugh because I'm so naive or ignorant and oblivious to something.
TrainSen	00001	 what kind of.
TrainSen	00001	 ok.
TrainSen	00001	 what REALLY FREAKIN bothers me about the Church's doctrine is the frenching thing.
TrainSen	00001	 its been bothering me for a long time.
TrainSen	00001	 probably longer than it should.
TrainSen	00001	 man, not EVERYONE goes straight to copulation after they french.
TrainSen	00001	 yeah, it may arouse the man.
TrainSen	00001	 or woman, but not really.
TrainSen	00100	 surely not.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't see WHY we can't until we're married.
TrainSen	00100	 its showing AFFECTION.
TrainSen	00100	 gets to know the other a bit more I guess.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't understand.
TrainSen	00100	 no comprendo!!! I  like my immortal by evanescence.
TrainSen	00100	 evanescence is a COOL name.
TrainSen	00100	 its a sad song though.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I could just not have ANY expectation about guys liking me so when one finally does, finally LOVES me, then I'll be surprised and it'll really reallly realllllly count.
TrainSen	00100	 I get so Disatisfied.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to go to rome, paris, england, switzerland, russia, romania, I want to speak all their languages!!!!! but look here.
TrainSen	00100	 there's no FUNDING no TIME for learning all of them.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I could feel the ever ""playful Presence"" like in Dean Koontz's book ""One Door Away From Heaven.
TrainSen	00100	 "" AWESOME BOOK.
TrainSen	00100	 I've got to do chemistry and finish my calculus.
TrainSen	00100	 CALCULUS IS FUUUUUUN!!!! the ta is cool but I DO NOT know what he tries to say when he teaches!!!!! he would've been a REALLLLLLY CUUUUUUUUTE guy if he wasn't gay.
TrainSen	00100	 tooooo baaaad.
TrainSen	00100	 I do not agree with homosexuality.
TrainSen	00100	 takes away from the beauty, sanity, naturality, rightness, sanctity of humanity and the world.
TrainSen	00100	 I ain't never lookin back, and that's a fact.
TrainSen	00100	 I've got pride I'm taking it for a ride.
TrainSen	00100	 I liketat song.
TrainSen	00100	 I like tiers, I'd like a really tiny tier for a pet.
TrainSen	00100	 that'd be soooooooo fun and not to mention cooooool.
TrainSen	00100	 dr.
TrainSen	00100	 moreau should have created mini-creatures for the future.
TrainSen	00100	 my time is almost up.
TrainSen	00100	 htis was a cool assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 I had a cup of noodle soup.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm really full.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like I don't have to eat for 3 days.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe I should try that.
TrainSen	00100	 see if I'm a SURVIVOR.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't think I'd DIE from that 3 day fast.
TrainSen	00100	 people stay around for longer without food.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish they didn't have to.
TrainSen	00001	     Damn if I didn't hit enter out of habit at fourteen minutes, submitted an incomplete, computers eat my soul, thinking though again on the great badmitten essay of 1999 in outdoor education, a gym coach that never read or listened to the students, known as fact, killed time by writing idiot descriptions of sporting history, history of badmitten, wrote mashed potatoes mashed potatoes mashed potatoes mashed potatoes filling my two pages, I got an A.
TrainSen	00001	 I met my girlfriend in that class, thinking back to short, white hair and anonymous breasts, she was drunk on our first date, she'd been with many other partners, she smoked and was vulger and knew everything about kandinsky, I painted a portrait of her standing next to a giant anthropomorphic hot dog outside the kodak theater, the hot dog dabbed his own head with ketchup, like a chicken spokesman for a chicken store, a cow for cavender's, or a retarded inmate on death row for the republican party, moving on my dreams dr are a numb series of catastrophic violence, eating brains of my best friends and crying for the deaths of assholes, once fought jack nicholson in a sea of burning ember monkeys, died by the hand of an explosive ship painting, buried under the weight of fat men, my last trip to big bend found me at the base of a babble agave, watching silver linings to form concentric circles around the great javelina head, tusking my eyes out so we could share a nice moment alone at sea, crying in the arms of alien waifs, couldn't fall asleep til I beat tyson in my mind, I graduate in three months with classes outside my interests cause they told me I took too much too much so now you need to suck it up and finish with the freshmen who are there because they don't know where else to be well I know where I need to be and it's not around this keyboard spilling oil into the duck's mouth and making him chase it with a beer, my cat soon yi just came into the room, hopped into my lap staring at these words march across this screen down the page and out of my life.
TrainSen	00100	     I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked"" soundtrack,  it's amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore.
TrainSen	00100	 stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate when people are like, ""yeah I party"", but I seriously did the  whole weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 now I feel dirty and gross.
TrainSen	00100	 I also ate like crap this whole weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 ew.
TrainSen	00100	 during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before.
TrainSen	00100	 what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting.
TrainSen	00100	 I'll get over it.
TrainSen	00100	 I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back.
TrainSen	00100	 I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg.
TrainSen	00100	 those three are like my favorite people in  the world.
TrainSen	00100	 this time seems to be going by so slowly.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't.
TrainSen	00100	 weird.
TrainSen	00100	 so back to camp.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy.
TrainSen	00100	 here, I'm not used to everything yet.
TrainSen	00100	 and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone.
TrainSen	00100	 you know what I mean? and I also miss adam.
TrainSen	00100	 this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to.
TrainSen	00100	 it's  our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 8th, I feel kind of bad about that.
TrainSen	00100	 what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about.
TrainSen	00100	 I love traci, my suitemate.
TrainSen	00100	 I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together.
TrainSen	00100	 despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision.
TrainSen	00100	 we've been getting along really well.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm thinking about ""friends"" right  now because it's my favorite show.
TrainSen	00100	 I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over.
TrainSen	00100	 but I'm excited to watch ""joey"" on Thursday.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will.
TrainSen	00100	 this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need.
TrainSen	00100	 hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book.
TrainSen	00100	 I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate science.
TrainSen	00100	 well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class.
TrainSen	00100	 so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace.
TrainSen	00100	 and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book.
TrainSen	00100	 I just figured something out about me.
TrainSen	00100	 I  hate bad spellers.
TrainSen	00100	 so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid.
TrainSen	00100	 which I am, but not everyone needs to know that.
TrainSen	00100	 my  brother, danny, always tells me I'm a weird kid.
TrainSen	00100	 he's so funny.
TrainSen	00100	 and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 16, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older.
TrainSen	00100	 danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way.
TrainSen	00100	 people always make fun of our family by calling  us the ""brady bunch"" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't  know why, but we all just get along.
TrainSen	00100	 my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world.
TrainSen	00100	 sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to.
TrainSen	00100	 and danny is awesome.
TrainSen	00100	 there's nothing not to like about him.
TrainSen	00100	 he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch.
TrainSen	00100	 some day, girls are going to fall all over  him.
TrainSen	00100	 they should.
TrainSen	00100	 me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother.
TrainSen	00100	 he's such a cute kid.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate when people do that.
TrainSen	00100	 I really don't know what else to talk about.
TrainSen	00100	 I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope that's still following the assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 so I'll start with  olivia geyelin.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks.
TrainSen	00100	 I  mean, I hate this girl.
TrainSen	00100	 she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on.
TrainSen	00100	 she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons.
TrainSen	00100	 ew.
TrainSen	00100	 but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever.
TrainSen	00100	 ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman.
TrainSen	00100	 ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling.
TrainSen	00100	 and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones.
TrainSen	00100	 ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb.
TrainSen	00100	 and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary.
TrainSen	00100	 and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true.
TrainSen	00100	 but I've known rikki since junior high.
TrainSen	00100	 ok now on to sarah  salon.
TrainSen	00100	 I used to hate sarah.
TrainSen	00100	 she's a bitch.
TrainSen	00100	 not kidding.
TrainSen	00100	 and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously.
TrainSen	00100	 now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit.
TrainSen	00100	 she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them.
TrainSen	00100	 sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships.
TrainSen	00100	 she's  always so much fun to be around.
TrainSen	00100	 I like her.
TrainSen	00100	 but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe it's in my  head, I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 but it's weird.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by.
TrainSen	00100	 ok after sarah, I only have favorites left.
TrainSen	00100	 everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends.
TrainSen	00100	 I'll start with lizzie albert.
TrainSen	00100	 Elizabeth Chandler Albert.
TrainSen	00100	 I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous.
TrainSen	00100	 and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter).
TrainSen	00100	 in our group of friends, we were the smartest.
TrainSen	00100	 we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time.
TrainSen	00100	 it really bothered me.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not joking.
TrainSen	00100	 it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand.
TrainSen	00100	 it was so bad.
TrainSen	00100	 we were never the same again.
TrainSen	00100	 but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin.
TrainSen	00100	 she's probably having the best time.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait to go visit her.
TrainSen	00100	 she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her.
TrainSen	00100	 Love her.
TrainSen	00100	 ok after lizzie  comes simone.
TrainSen	00100	 I met simone actually a long time ago.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe in 1997.
TrainSen	00100	 she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin.
TrainSen	00100	 then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school.
TrainSen	00100	 then we  became best friends.
TrainSen	00100	 I LOVE simone.
TrainSen	00100	 she cracks me up and is so great.
TrainSen	00100	 we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me.
TrainSen	00100	 we took this class together called 20th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate sounding cheesy but it's true.
TrainSen	00100	 there's no one I'd rather  be in 20th with than simone.
TrainSen	00100	 simone's dad died the day before her 5th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom.
TrainSen	00100	 she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close.
TrainSen	00100	 her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult.
TrainSen	00100	 she does things by herself and is really mature.
TrainSen	00100	 love her.
TrainSen	00100	 she  goes to bradley which is so good for her.
TrainSen	00100	 I really hope she's happy.
TrainSen	00100	 she rocks my  world.
TrainSen	00100	 after simone comes marisa.
TrainSen	00100	 LOVE marisa.
TrainSen	00100	 we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year.
TrainSen	00100	 then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable.
TrainSen	00100	 we were best friends.
TrainSen	00100	 me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome.
TrainSen	00100	 she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk.
TrainSen	00100	 I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there.
TrainSen	00100	 marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean.
TrainSen	00100	 she had sex when she was 12 or 13, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules.
TrainSen	00100	 Which the exact opposite of me.
TrainSen	00100	 but she's great and I  love her.
TrainSen	00100	 she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year.
TrainSen	00100	 that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore.
TrainSen	00100	 she goes to  indiana, and she loves it.
TrainSen	00100	 both her parents went there and loved it.
TrainSen	00100	 her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority.
TrainSen	00100	 marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much.
TrainSen	00100	 she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that.
TrainSen	00100	 love her.
TrainSen	00100	 and last, I'll talk about  Hillary.
TrainSen	00100	 I love her.
TrainSen	00100	 I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta.
TrainSen	00100	 she was  always the little girl that everybody loved.
TrainSen	00100	 we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year.
TrainSen	00100	 she' so great.
TrainSen	00100	 I  honestly love her and miss her so much.
TrainSen	00100	 she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in.
TrainSen	00100	 Ass holes.
TrainSen	00100	 but I don't think she would have come here anyways.
TrainSen	00100	 I can  talk to hillary about everything.
TrainSen	00100	 I love her.
TrainSen	00100	 she goes to illinois.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait to go visit  her.
TrainSen	00100	 she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed.
TrainSen	00100	 she's so funny and a great person to be with.
TrainSen	00100	 we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great.
TrainSen	00100	 the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me.
TrainSen	00100	 and we were on poms together.
TrainSen	00100	 She was  even my big sister one year.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss poms.
TrainSen	00100	 and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much.
TrainSen	00100	 she's so cute and so talented.
TrainSen	00100	 she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore.
TrainSen	00100	 sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people.
TrainSen	00100	 ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam.
TrainSen	00100	 adam jeffrey silver.
TrainSen	00100	 I  met the kid the first day of high school.
TrainSen	00100	 I was like, damn he's hot.
TrainSen	00100	 we were in like 3  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other.
TrainSen	00100	 we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since.
TrainSen	00100	 he's my best friend in the entire world.
TrainSen	00100	 he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me.
TrainSen	00100	 he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss him so much.
TrainSen	00100	 sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now.
TrainSen	00100	 how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great.
TrainSen	00001	At this very moment I feel anoyed and somewhat angry at what I see everyday.
TrainSen	00001	 For example, there was a notice on my apartment door that I read after coming home from school.
TrainSen	00001	 It stated that there was a homicide in the apartment complex.
TrainSen	00001	 about 3 days ago there was another notice that warned about an armed robbery nearby.
TrainSen	00001	 When I ride the Ut shuttle busses to school, I notice that now a days there is no sense of courtesy, nobody thanks the driver and students don't even bother to notice traffic when crossing streets.
TrainSen	00001	 everyone is too caught up in their own little worlds to even show some form of humane decency.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know why I get angry when I think of this, maybe I pay too much attention to things I shouldn't.
TrainSen	00001	 I have always disliked people but loved individuals, but what can be done to improve or avoid ignorence bbut to simply choose not to act irrational.
TrainSen	00001	 enough of that.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I am beggining to think of all the things I must do.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel rather confused because I don't know if I should quite my job.
TrainSen	00001	 It is not easy at all to be a full time student and work over 30 hours a week as a waiter at Antonios Tex Mex.
TrainSen	00001	 On top of that, I just moved from apartment complexes, and I have not completely finished orginizing my stuff at my new apartment.
TrainSen	00001	 There is an empty Burger King bag infront of me and I feel guilty.
TrainSen	00001	 You see about 1 year and 5 months ago, I used to be very fit, I mean I had it all.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm 6 ft.
TrainSen	00001	 tall, and during that time, I weighed about 200 lbs but out of pure muscle, I was scorching hot.
TrainSen	00001	 That is around the time I meat my girlfriend (I hope you don't think this is cheesy) and so we got together; about five months passed, and I just ballooned into 265 lbs.
TrainSen	00001	 The reason I stated earlier that I felt guilty for eating the burger was because I am trying to get back in shape.
TrainSen	00001	 And I also feel bad because I know that my partner worries about my health.
TrainSen	00001	 But I do get satisfaction and happiness due to the choices I've made in my life, I chose to stay in school and never do drugs, also I have a person who has been with me in great times as well as tough times, and has had love for me in my horrible looking days as much as in my good looking days.
TrainSen	01000	  Okay I was asked to write about the way that I'm thinking this is an pretty easy assignment, but then comes what am I suppose to write about and is it really that easy to put thoughts to paper.
TrainSen	01000	 I know one thing is I sure do really want to go back to houston where life was much easier and fun.
TrainSen	01000	 Here people are to damn concieted and full of them selves, theis mainly means the females, maybe its cause I'm hispanic or something.
TrainSen	01000	 Either way I never had diffulty meeting girls.
TrainSen	01000	 Well its probably cause I miss my gurl my lil china back in h-town.
TrainSen	01000	 Hmmmmmmmmmmm what else mann I'm bored and tired and I wonder why my led hurts.
TrainSen	01000	 Its been doing that all week.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not as athletic as I use to be that makes me sound like an old person.
TrainSen	01000	 But foreal though its so boring out here parties are bunk.
TrainSen	01000	 Who the called me today have no idea who was that girl I wish I knew who she was thought she sounded reallly good though.
TrainSen	01000	 Lets see what else is there to say I don't really feel like college has got hard yet but I feel it coming.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I'm ready when all the hard works hits me BAAaMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!  Just like that.
TrainSen	01000	 I realize that I do think of gurls a lot that's crazy even right now I'm talking about gurls haaaa.
TrainSen	01000	 Hmmmmm will I meet a girl out here who will at least be my friend.
TrainSen	01000	 Maannn this stupid computer is slow and these dum pop ups keep coming up man I didn't realize that 20 min was this long man I forgot how to type fast so ill just use this as practice I guess.
TrainSen	01000	 Soooooooo lets see Wow there sure is a lot of porn online stupid popups trying to distract me all the time just leave me alone like micheal jackson mann that guys weird I feel srry for those kids lol.
TrainSen	01000	 no but really that's sick I'm on 12 min and 10 sec.
TrainSen	01000	 hmm doesn't seem like I said a lot so man I really not liking austin if this continues I'm going back home.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't kjnow though I got freedom here like I would have in houston there I got a person watching me which is goood but how willl I ever grow without learning on my own.
TrainSen	01000	 I actually learned how to wash clothes out here that's a big accomplish ment seein that I never did that.
TrainSen	01000	 Yep I can a lot if I put my mind to it those white kids won't know what hit them when I get all my grades up and start knowing more people imma take there gurls lol.
TrainSen	01000	 Then every body willl be on my swangers foreal  mann those cookies smell good but if I take my hands off the keyboard then ill stop typing and that's no good screw it let me get a cookie.
TrainSen	01000	 Hmmmmmmmmm that's good lol.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I'm chatting ca;use I just don't care about grammer.
TrainSen	01000	 I need some music its so boring and what kind of crap do they jamm down hurrr its so weak and so is the dancing.
TrainSen	01000	 yup good old h-town inned to go back and chill with my friends and especially Lindsey My Love man forreal though I miss her most of all its like when I say I miss houston I mean her cause she's the only thing worth going back for.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe in the future if it was meant to be ill meet here again and well fall in love all over agian!  I wish but she's beatiful she wouldn't be single and she's just perfect.
TrainSen	01000	 I heart her.
TrainSen	00100	     hello professor, I'm doing your little writing assignment even though I have no clue what to write so Ill do what you said to do and wirte about anything that comes to my head.
TrainSen	00100	 today I have to do a lot of study work, not much else to do b.
TrainSen	00100	 C I lifted weights and played bball yesterday for bout 6 hours and now I'm in the UT cycling team and its pretty damn cool.
TrainSen	00100	 I should excel in this sport because I know how to push my body harder than anyone I know, no matter what the test I always push my body harder than everyone else.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to be the best no matter what the sport or event.
TrainSen	00100	 I should also be good at this because I love to ride my bike and to do it as a sport? wow lots of fun.
TrainSen	00100	 music.
TrainSen	00100	 hmmm I like it a lot, I have lots of it in fact I have about 15 GB of music on this computer which is about 5,000 songs so I have a wide variety of music and that's good to have, its also good to have know a lot of things which is exactly what I do, I know lots of stuff that nobody else would know.
TrainSen	00100	 I am extremely good at jeopardy and I usually have as much money as the winner and the funny part about it is, they have had college and lots of schooling, most of the contestants were graduate students and I have just begun college.
TrainSen	00100	 by the way my classes are in no way difficult, I hope your class doesn't get hard because I have a a lot of calculus which isn't hard, just very time consuming.
TrainSen	00100	 what to write, haha now that I ask an opportunity has presented itself, a girl that I know just said hi, got me some of that last weekend, I've known her all my life and she looks pretty good too, she goes to tarleton(redneck city) but its ok, its still good.
TrainSen	00100	 I have a way with people, if I can talk to them for about 10 minutes I can get them to really like me and if I want to I can make them do almost anything(no alchohol has to be used).
TrainSen	00100	 you can ask my best bud who goes to school here, he knows that I have a way with people and I do that's what's so cool about this.
TrainSen	00100	 I have a great life ahead of me and I want to live it to the fullest and no matter what I say on here I can't stop typing so I will continue and the music is great by the way damn I've got to go home this weekend, everyone misses me too much although I don't miss any of them except this girl that I went out with for bout 2 years, lots of fun there, I love her yes I do and she loves me but since I left we broke up and now she's trapped with a druggie b.
TrainSen	00100	 C if she dumps him he will either kill himself or me so she's very scared but I don't care, it will all work itself out in time I just hope it won't take forever.
TrainSen	00100	 my calculus teacher is skin a real social reject, he has no body mass, he is skinnier than a toothpick and his clothes almost fall off of him its funny to look at that finish button is looking really good right now, as in extremley good, I wish I could click it right now but I can't b.
TrainSen	00100	 C my 20 isn't finished yet so I will continue in my efforts to type and type continuously like you wanted, geez 20 minutes is a long time to just type and have nobody type back to you although I have writted letters that have taken me 3 hours to write and consisted of about 10 pages of paper, but I don't care, I don't care about much anyways, just my grades got to keep them up, I care about my family my future and the girl back home, I care about my frineds, I care about my physical health and looks that's why I love to be in shape but other than that, I don't care about much of anything, there is no reason to care and by the way I SUPPORT BUSH he is a good man and if the media didn't give him such a hard rap about things people would like him a lot more the only reason many people don't is because of the media, I even ask them why they don't like him and all they can say is just because, I reeally wisht tthat they would take the time to research things and see who the btter candidate for the president is which is obviously BUSH!!! anyways I don't really liek the music that is playing right now its not really that cool and has no good beat at all, music is a beautiful artform wchich I believe is the best ever but who cares? nobody.
TrainSen	00010	I believe in the future of agriculture, with a faith born not of words, but of deeds.
TrainSen	00010	 Better days through better ways.
TrainSen	00010	 That's all of the Creed to the FFA I can rememeber, although I had to recite it for many times.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel somewhat out of place in my apartment with 4 other room mates because I pay the least rent but I have the most disposable income.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not sure if I spell a lot of words incorrectly because I'm dyslexic.
TrainSen	00010	 I will say that by typing, my spelling improves.
TrainSen	00010	 My hand writing is horrible.
TrainSen	00010	 I can bearly read the things I write.
TrainSen	00010	 I've worked out deals with most all of my teachers in the past about letting me take assignments home and write them.
TrainSen	00010	 Man, this room is hot.
TrainSen	00010	 I just turned on the fan but it's still way too hot.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to take guitar and speed reading classes.
TrainSen	00010	 Those are two areas of my life in which I think I drastically need improvement.
TrainSen	00010	 Although, none of which are pertinent to my life right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I supose the speed reading class might be.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm so far behind in my readings for all my classes, I don't want to start.
TrainSen	00010	 Twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder how many books have started, or been intirely written with not forthought what so ever going into the plot.
TrainSen	00010	 I had a dream I thought should be a book the other night, but I can't remember it.
TrainSen	00010	 My memmory has been getting worse daily.
TrainSen	00010	 Not just because of the alcohol consumption.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I'm acutally drinking less now than I did in high school.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm feeling an excess load of self inflicted stress lately, and I think it should get a little worse in the next coulpe days and then a lot better.
TrainSen	00010	 My girl friend of over a year and a half and I broke up a couple weeks ago, but continued to date.
TrainSen	00010	 The part that bothers me is that I don't have the same free time as she does, so all my free time still goes to her, but she's dating other people.
TrainSen	00010	 I told her today that I wanted to sever ties for 3 weeks and see how that goes.
TrainSen	00010	 She's totally against it, and if I were her, I would be too.
TrainSen	00010	 She still has the comanionship of her 1st and longest boyfriend, and can date other people on the side.
TrainSen	00010	 One of which is the same age as my 23 year old brother who is a huge reason we broke up in the first place.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel this pain inside me I've never felt before when I hear her talking about going places with him.
TrainSen	00010	 But like my roommate says, there's nothing like a good jam secion.
TrainSen	00010	 He's talking about music, but I want to jam with some other girls.
TrainSen	00010	 Get my mind off of her.
TrainSen	00010	 I know that the migranes and headaches are from her, and that she really is being selfish most of the time, and she's not really my ""type,""  if there is a type for anyone.
TrainSen	00010	 But I find myself unable to stop thinking about her.
TrainSen	00010	 I met another girl the other day who has more incommon with me than anyone I've ever met.
TrainSen	00010	 She's beautiful and got into UT.
TrainSen	00010	 That means brains and beauty.
TrainSen	00010	 She's just coming off of a break up from her long time boyfriend through high school as well.
TrainSen	00010	 My main hesitation about persuing her is that I don't want either of us to mentaly, or physically, get involved just because we think we need someone at the moment.
TrainSen	00010	 Besides, I think she's too active for me.
TrainSen	00010	 she's the social director of her sorority.
TrainSen	00010	 Another thing that's been stressing me out is the fact that my cholesterol is 253, and my LDL (the bad kind) is 183, higher than most people's total.
TrainSen	00010	 The doctor told me I needed to get on medication as sooon as possible and gave me sample packages that should last me atleast a month to be sure I had time to get my perscription filled.
TrainSen	00010	 My first thought was to get a second opinion about the medication, but I feel confident that any doctor would tell me the same thing.
TrainSen	00010	 I would tell someone the same thing and I don't have a degree.
TrainSen	00010	 But I can't convince my self to take it.
TrainSen	00010	 No studies have been done to document the sideeffects of the medication on someone as young as my self.
TrainSen	00010	 When I asked the Doctor about them, she said that I should just take half the recomended dosage and I should be okay.
TrainSen	00010	 I decided against the medication and I've drastically changed my eating habbits, althought I didn't think they were that bad to begin with.
TrainSen	00010	 I've never been out of shape persay, but I can tell my body's getting back into shape.
TrainSen	00010	 I used to be very fit, but after quitting high school sports my junior year, I began to slack off.
TrainSen	00010	 And I found the girl that I just recently broke up with, so doing workout stuff didn't compare to her.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I'm going to start running soon.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm lifing now more then I get my cardio up, and while it's helping my muscles get back to looking right, I don't think it's giving me the help that I need.
TrainSen	00010	 We, the people in my apartment, have decided, because of me, to each by their own groceries.
TrainSen	00010	 I was tired of paying for all the stuff they eat when I wouldn't have any of it.
TrainSen	00010	 I was buying all my stuff extra anyway, and they still wanted me to pay 25 bucks a aweek for ""community food""  looks like my time is up.
TrainSen	01000	     Usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, ""How am I going to do it?  Where do I start?  Where do I finish?  How do I know that I am doing it right?""  This is my situation exactly with this writing assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 Its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait till Saturday because I will attend the first UT football game this season, which I might add, will be my first time to attend one.
TrainSen	01000	 The weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when I was up here for summer school.
TrainSen	01000	 Its a real drag.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm always so tired I hate it.
TrainSen	01000	 Labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe I'll go visit Brett (an El Paso friend) at the hidious A & M, College Station, the drive is a drag though.
TrainSen	01000	 The road trip that me and Lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me.
TrainSen	01000	 All they're concerned about is putting UT down or ""TU"" as they call us since we're not ""THE"" University of Texas but ""A"" Texas University!  Isn't it stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 Still admit I'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car.
TrainSen	01000	 Its sad how immaturity can get the best of people.
TrainSen	01000	 They do have a lot of school spirit.
TrainSen	01000	 Makes me wish that I was into that stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 Who knows, maybe when all the football games start.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to see how crazy us Longhorns really get.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait till softball games start, I want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!!  Hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, I will be ready to try out.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm really discouraged about trying out this year, I know I'm not ready.
TrainSen	01000	 My family's encouragement helps but I don't want to make a fool out of myself.
TrainSen	01000	 I can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a UT uniform.
TrainSen	01000	 How amazing.
TrainSen	01000	 That is my goal!!  If I can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't I have a shot on the team.
TrainSen	01000	 I just think that I lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level.
TrainSen	01000	 It may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game.
TrainSen	01000	 I love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom.
TrainSen	01000	 Don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in.
TrainSen	01000	 I love it.
TrainSen	01000	 There are a lot more responsibilities though, but I'm picking up on the time management.
TrainSen	01000	 The Incubus concert is coming up and I'm (since yesterday) going.
TrainSen	01000	 I've only heard a few songs by them so I can't say that I'm an ""all out"" fan of theirs.
TrainSen	01000	 But hey I'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert.
TrainSen	01000	 I should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it.
TrainSen	01000	 Its worth the experience.
TrainSen	00010	So.
TrainSen	00010	 I am overwhelmed.
TrainSen	00010	 I wouldn't say that I'm completely overwhelmed and feel like crying, but I feel a little stressed out.
TrainSen	00010	 I am not used to all this studying and it's proving to be a little harder than I thought.
TrainSen	00010	 So much reading.
TrainSen	00010	 It seems like it will never end.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like I will never be caught up.
TrainSen	00010	 I have to read so many pages for all of my classes except math.
TrainSen	00010	 I was worried about math but so far, it's my easiest class.
TrainSen	00010	 Well, I guess it's good that it's not hard too.
TrainSen	00010	 My classes aren't really difficult but there is just so much reading.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm scared about the first test that I will take.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm afraid that I'm going to make a really bad grade and maybe even fail it.
TrainSen	00010	 I would be devestated.
TrainSen	00010	 So, I'm trying to study a lot.
TrainSen	00010	 It feels like I am studying a lot but I guess I won't know if it's all sufficient until that first test.
TrainSen	00010	 Man, this is going pretty slow.
TrainSen	00010	 It's only been three and a half minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 Only 17 more to go.
TrainSen	00010	 Well, this is the easiest writings that I've had to do so far.
TrainSen	00010	 Just write exactly what is going through my head.
TrainSen	00010	 Can't be that hard.
TrainSen	00010	 Me and my roommate had our first disagreement last night.
TrainSen	00010	 I promised her that I wouldn't smoke a cigarette at this party and then she caught me taking a drag.
TrainSen	00010	 I felt really bad about lying to her.
TrainSen	00010	 Yeah, I was drunk but it was still wrong.
TrainSen	00010	 So, this morning I told her that I was really sorry and blah blah blah.
TrainSen	00010	 She said that it was cool and everything but I don't want it to change our friendship.
TrainSen	00010	 I still want her to be able to trust me.
TrainSen	00010	 I know that it's just a stupid little fight but it really scares me that she might never trust me like she used to.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess that it will all work out for the best.
TrainSen	00010	 I love Austin so much.
TrainSen	00010	 It's an awesome place to be.
TrainSen	00010	 There are so many good places to eat and shop and just look at.
TrainSen	00010	 My home town only has about 1000 people in it.
TrainSen	00010	 So Austin is a good change for me.
TrainSen	00010	 But I do miss my parents and my bed and my shower.
TrainSen	00010	 Man, these beds in Jester suck.
TrainSen	00010	 I wake up and I'm sore.
TrainSen	00010	 So, I hurt my ankle pretty bad about a week ago.
TrainSen	00010	 We're suing the 7-11 that I tripped at because they handled the situation really badly and treated me very rudly.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate, Dana, was awesome throughout it all.
TrainSen	00010	 I really couldn't have done it without her.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm glad that we don't hate eachother.
TrainSen	00010	 But I hope that I get some money from the 7-11.
TrainSen	00010	 It would be nice to be able to pay for an apartment next year with out having to get my parents to pay for it.
TrainSen	00010	 They have 3 kids in college at the same time so it's going to be a tough year for them, financially.
TrainSen	00010	 Dana treats guys really weird.
TrainSen	00010	 I would say, wrong, but it's just different than I treat guys.
TrainSen	00010	 She's so wishy washy and is like cheating on all of her boyfriends.
TrainSen	00010	 It kind of bothers me but if that's the way she is, I can't try and change her or preach to her about how I think she should be acting.
TrainSen	00010	 Man, if my other papers were this easy to write, I would have so much more time on my hands.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm only taking 12 hours, so I feel like a slacker.
TrainSen	00010	 The thing is that if I were taking any more, I think I might cry a lot more.
TrainSen	00010	 When will the reading ever end?!?!?! Only 8 more minutes to go.
TrainSen	00010	 Wow, this is easy.
TrainSen	00010	 Our dorm room used to be freezing cold but I taped some paper over the vent which made it a lot better.
TrainSen	00010	 It's pretty ghetto looking, but it works.
TrainSen	00010	 I haven't been able to exercise for a long time.
TrainSen	00010	 I have to wait until my ankle is better.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't even wear tennis shoes yet! Man, I feel so lazy and fat when I don't work out.
TrainSen	00010	 Exercising makes me feel good! Damn that 7-11! And I bought a Texercise pass too! I'm losing some money there.
TrainSen	00010	 I have handicap parking but it runs out on Wednesday.
TrainSen	00010	 It's been really handy! Bont, that's a word that my ex-boyfriend made up when he was in 7th grade.
TrainSen	00010	 I've tought it to a lot of people here and everybody loves to say it.
TrainSen	00010	 It makes me so happy when I hear my new UT friends say it because it reminds me of the good things about home.
TrainSen	00010	 And it reminds me of Matt too.
TrainSen	00010	 So, I love to hear a good ole' bont every once in a while.
TrainSen	00010	 The girls next door are really loud sometimes and I don't think that they like me.
TrainSen	00010	 They've been really bitchy so far and that bums me out because I like to get along with everybody.
TrainSen	00010	 There is this guy a few doors down from me and he's really cool.
TrainSen	00010	 We like the same music and movies and all that good stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 He's kind of crazy though.
TrainSen	00010	 But I like crazy sometimes.
TrainSen	00010	 Aren't we all a little crazy? But he's not that attractive, he's kind of a big guy.
TrainSen	00010	 But, I've seen pictures of him when he was in high school and he was really cute.
TrainSen	00010	 It bothers me that this bothers me.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not the type of person who judges others, especially by the way they look.
TrainSen	00010	 It's not even like I'm judging him.
TrainSen	00010	 I just think that we get along really well but I would probably never date him and it bothers me to think that I'm that vain.
TrainSen	00010	 But I'm really just rambling and none of this makes sense very much.
TrainSen	00010	 I know how I'm feeling, but when I try to write it, it doesn't come out right.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00010	 At least I know what I feel.
TrainSen	00010	 Or at least, I think I know.
TrainSen	00100	     I hate walking all over the place at this school.
TrainSen	00100	 My calves are going to double in size and they already don't fit into boots When I jumped horses I had to buy custom made boots so that my calves could fit into them.
TrainSen	00100	 My mom has big calves too.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe it runs in the family.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't really now anything else about calves.
TrainSen	00100	 Weird thing to talk about probably, but mine really hurt right now beacuse of all the walking.
TrainSen	00100	 It seems like everyplace I have to go is all the way across c ampus.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00100	 walking will probably be good for me.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe with all the walking I could loose some weight and make my ex-boyfriend wish that he didn't break up with me.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I'll dye my hair red too.
TrainSen	00100	 He'd like that.
TrainSen	00100	 Ha Ha Ha.
TrainSen	00100	 I think my hair would look good red.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I should dye it but I hear a lot of people say don't do it.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I should.
TrainSen	00100	 Sonce I'm so pale I would like to have some depth.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like my blonde hair washes me out.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like I'm Hemmingway.
TrainSen	00100	 Short choppy sentences merely stating what's going on around him.
TrainSen	00100	 His short choppy sentences had deep meaning though.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if my sentences have any deep meaning.
TrainSen	00100	 Probably not since I have been talking about calves and hair.
TrainSen	00100	 So it goes.
TrainSen	00100	 I think about a lot of things.
TrainSen	00100	 Sometimes I think so much that I can't fall asleep at night.
TrainSen	00100	 When that happens I spray some stuff that smell like lavender on my pillows and fall right asleep.
TrainSen	00100	 Lavender smells so good.
TrainSen	00100	 I also like that color.
TrainSen	00100	 It might be my favorite.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know because I like really deep eggplant.
TrainSen	00100	 Yeah.
TrainSen	00100	 Eggplant it pretty, not a very good looking vegetalbe however.
TrainSen	00100	 Good color bad vegetable.
TrainSen	00100	 They don't taste very good either.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't like many vegetables.
TrainSen	00100	 I like good that makes you fat.
TrainSen	00100	 It just tastes better.
TrainSen	00100	 My mom always yells at me when I eat fatting food.
TrainSen	00100	 Sometimes when I just eat I get look.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my mom.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my car.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I could go get in my car and blare the stereo and smoke.
TrainSen	00100	 That would be great.
TrainSen	00100	 It really gets all the stress out.
TrainSen	00100	 I love doing that.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my car.
TrainSen	00100	 I also miss my cats, my friends, my ex.
TrainSen	00100	 When I see happy couples I want to throw rocks at them.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't but it frustrates me when I see how happy I used to be with another person, but in someone else.
TrainSen	00100	 Then I start to think of him and I get sad.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh good this is almost over this was harder than I thought.
TrainSen	00100	 Trying to type really slows down your thinking.
TrainSen	00100	 But perhaps I am just a slow typer.
TrainSen	00100	 I probably should have learned how to properly type when I was a kid.
TrainSen	00100	 I just didn't think it was important then.
TrainSen	00100	 They should have a service like maids who come to your house and type stuff for you.
TrainSen	00100	 Another thing I wish I would have done is learn to play an instrament.
TrainSen	00100	 There is something so refined about a woman who can play an instrament.
TrainSen	00100	 There is also something very attractive about a guy who can play something, guitar, piano and whatnot.
TrainSen	00100	 Very cool.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe beacuse they seem more sensative.
TrainSen	00100	 That is very important.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh good 30 seconds Yeah!! I have so much more to do tonight.
TrainSen	00100	     I went to church tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes me feel very calm and relaxed.
TrainSen	00100	 It puts the world into such a different perspective.
TrainSen	00100	 Everything seems so simple.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes me want to be a much better person.
TrainSen	00100	 The television is on.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it's on MTV.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not watching it though.
TrainSen	00100	 That's annoying song on that commercial.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't want to go back to school on Tuesday.
TrainSen	00100	 I have a lot of work to do including reading for this class.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait till Friday.
TrainSen	00100	 I get to go home, and my boyfriend is coming in town.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate commercials.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't like eating college food.
TrainSen	00100	 I really miss not having to worry about going out and getting something to eat.
TrainSen	00100	 My roommate went home for the weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 It's weird being here alone.
TrainSen	00100	 I have been going to sleep late this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 I turned off the TV.
TrainSen	00100	 I went to the football game last night.
TrainSen	00100	 It was fun.
TrainSen	00100	 There was a lot of drunk people there though who snuck in alcohol.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes me almost think that they should just sell beer at the games so people wouldn't sneak it in.
TrainSen	00100	 It's very quiet.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to join clubs here.
TrainSen	00100	 I really want to volunteer at like a pregnancy help center.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to make a difference that way.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm really hungry so I am eating burnt popcorn.
TrainSen	00100	 I will prob.
TrainSen	00100	 make some more after I finish this.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what the point of this is.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it's a cool assignment, but I wonder what it is going to show about the way I think.
TrainSen	00100	 I want my boyfriend to call.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss him a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 I saw my friends today.
TrainSen	00100	 I bought sandals with a little brasilian flag on them.
TrainSen	00100	 They are really cute.
TrainSen	00100	 My boyfriend is from Brasil.
TrainSen	00100	 It just occurred to me that I'm not sure if you spell that county with a s or a z.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm a horrible speller.
TrainSen	00100	 The tower was so pretty last night.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it is my favorite part of campus.
TrainSen	00100	 I look at it everyday, and it reminds me that anything can be accomplished if you put your mind to it.
TrainSen	00100	 I love it.
TrainSen	00100	 I like how you can see the capitol building too at the same spot by the tower.
TrainSen	00100	 They're just really cool.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I hear one of my suite mates.
TrainSen	00100	 She went to visit her boyfriend in San Marcus.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish my boyfriend was closer.
TrainSen	00100	 It's hard having him so far away.
TrainSen	00100	 I know everything will work out though because I love him so very much.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't wait till Friday.
TrainSen	00100	 It was really cool visiting him in Michigan.
TrainSen	00100	 My dad's birthday is coming up on the 26th.
TrainSen	00100	 That is also Luis and I's 5 month anniversary.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow.
TrainSen	00100	 that's a long time.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to marry him.
TrainSen	00100	 That may sound weird.
TrainSen	00100	 too soon or whatever.
TrainSen	00100	 But it's true.
TrainSen	00100	 I never thought I would find someone so amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 He told me that he wants to marry me someday.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish that I could fastfoward college sometimes so we could be together again.
TrainSen	00100	 I went to this meeting on studying abroad on Friday.
TrainSen	00100	 It was pretty boring.
TrainSen	00100	 It was interesting how many countries you can go to.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to do that one day.
TrainSen	00100	 That would be fun to experience another culture.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean I've been to Europe before but only for a couple of weeks.
TrainSen	00100	 Not long enough to learn about it in-depth.
TrainSen	00100	 I have noticed how dead it is on campus on the weekends.
TrainSen	00100	 It's kind of sad.
TrainSen	00100	 Especially this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm surprised how many people left.
TrainSen	00100	 I love the picture of my baby next to my printer.
TrainSen	00100	 He's so adorable.
TrainSen	00100	 He makes me feel so special.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm thirsty.
TrainSen	00100	 Why isn't my boyfriend calling me? I love the sound of his voice.
TrainSen	00100	 I forgot that I wanted to call my mom today.
TrainSen	00100	 I wanted to tell her about the game and find out about Bridgette.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope she is alright.
TrainSen	00100	 The priest at church prayed for the people in Florida.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm happy that Carmen goes to church now.
TrainSen	00100	 My friend once told me that she didn't believe in God.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope she does now.
TrainSen	00100	 I almost started crying in church because I was so happy.
TrainSen	00100	 I like when my boyfriend goes to church with me.
TrainSen	00100	 He's such a better person now that he's going out with me.
TrainSen	00100	 It's amazing how much he's changed.
TrainSen	00100	 He stopped drinking.
TrainSen	00100	 Not that he won't have a sip every once in a while, but before he would drink every weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 He wouldn't get drunk but still he would drink a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to talk to my friend ben.
TrainSen	00100	 He's at LSU.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow.
TrainSen	00100	 20 minutes is a long time.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't believe I'm still writing.
TrainSen	00100	 It's getting pretty boring.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what else to think about.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my nephews they are so cute.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't see how anyone could ever have an abortion.
TrainSen	00100	 That's so incredibly sad.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope I can help put an end to abortions one day.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes me sick just thinking about it.
TrainSen	00100	 I really don't like analynn.
TrainSen	00100	 Goodness she is very mean and fat.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm glad that I never have to see her.
TrainSen	00010	I need to get out more.
TrainSen	00010	 I work all the time and go to school, and leaves so little time forme.
TrainSen	00010	 Both of my parents a sick and living at home was kind of already planed.
TrainSen	00010	 It makes you a stronger person to get stuck doing the stuff I do, but I wonder what it would be like to be normal.
TrainSen	00010	 What it would be like to be selfish or not even selfish,but to not have so many people relie on me.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to meet boys and just hang out, but I'm so shy.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I look ok, but is ok enough? I'm 22 years old and one guy has approched me with saying something to make me mad.
TrainSen	00010	 A lot of my frinds insted of being happy for me are so negative.
TrainSen	00010	 We are no dating, I've never been on a date, so should be single for ever.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss steven, but should I he's been sent overseas probably to fight.
TrainSen	00010	 I only knew him for a few days and then he got his orders to leave.
TrainSen	00010	 He gave me his phone number, but I can't call him.
TrainSen	10000	     Well, this is interesting.
TrainSen	10000	 Let's see.
TrainSen	10000	 right now, I feel like I'm not even doing homework, really.
TrainSen	10000	 Sarika, Mary and Natasha are quizzing each other on medical terminology, which seems so much more.
TrainSen	10000	 studious than what I'm doing.
TrainSen	10000	 But I don't mind.
TrainSen	10000	 Let's see.
TrainSen	10000	 my hands have been smelling kind of funny.
TrainSen	10000	 Like rust, almost.
TrainSen	10000	 But I haven't touched anything rusty.
TrainSen	10000	 Except, I did clean the shower today, and maybe the combination of ammonia and old residue causes such a smell, even when you're using gloves.
TrainSen	10000	 Other than that, I don't really smell anything.
TrainSen	10000	 God, my stomach is rumbling like crazy now.
TrainSen	10000	 I really want to eat.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm so mad at myself, if I had just gone to that Freshman Business meeting, I would be eating free pizza now.
TrainSen	10000	 But no, I have to be a ""conformist"" and go when all my other friends are going.
TrainSen	10000	 Now I have to pay for my food.
TrainSen	10000	 And even now, I'll probably end up waiting until the other three girls in the room are done studying.
TrainSen	10000	 Why am I such a follower?  I hope I gain some leadership qualities through my college experience.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder why the microfridge makes that noise, that constant hum.
TrainSen	10000	 Did you know, something's wrong with the microfridge in my room.
TrainSen	10000	 We had it set at level 5, and we open the door, and find that our water bottles have ice in them rather than water, and there are pearly crystals in our milk.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, that was weird.
TrainSen	10000	 I lowered the temperature a little, hopefully that helps.
TrainSen	10000	 The strange thing is, our suitemates had their microfridge set at a little past level 5, and their food is fine.
TrainSen	10000	 Aren't all the microfridges supposed to be the same?  Fridge discrimination.
TrainSen	10000	 Anyway.
TrainSen	10000	 what else is there to say?  My eyes feel sleepy.
TrainSen	10000	 Not in the heavy sense though, where you feel as though you couldn't keep your lids up if your life depended on it.
TrainSen	10000	 No, not that kind of sleepy.
TrainSen	10000	 It's the kind where your eyes slightly burn when you close them, and you have mild sinus symptoms.
TrainSen	10000	 Or perhaps this feeling is due more to an oncoming sinus attack rather than my sleepiness.
TrainSen	10000	 Either way, I should be sleepy, I did a lot of work today.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm so proud of my productivity today.
TrainSen	10000	 After calculus, I went straight to the library, printed out my UBC application, then went straight to one of the desks and did my Psychology homework.
TrainSen	10000	 That's right, two and a half hours of reading and taking notes.
TrainSen	10000	 I even drew a rudimentary picture of a neuron.
TrainSen	10000	 Whoa.
TrainSen	10000	 Sometimes I think I work too hard.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean, did I really have to write down all the processes of the neurons?  Ultimately, I probably won't need half the stuff I've taken note of.
TrainSen	10000	 Luckily, I actually kind of enjoy psychology, so I don't mind taking the notes.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I need to spit out this gum.
TrainSen	10000	 It's like I'm chewing rubber or something.
TrainSen	10000	 And my jaw hurts from all the exercise it's gotten.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I've had this gum in my mouth for about two hours, if not more.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I have to laugh at the way these girls are studying.
TrainSen	10000	 They're thinking of ways to remember all the terminology.
TrainSen	10000	 Here's the funniest one: ""penia"" means abnormal reduction.
TrainSen	10000	 So, what does my gutter-mind think of?  Hahaha.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't help it, I'm still immature.
TrainSen	10000	 Hopefully my professors don't get wind of it.
TrainSen	10000	 But you must admit, that's a good way to remember ""penia"", isn't it?  I'm not even in medical terminology, and I will always remember that term.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh God, my eyes are starting to feel a little heavy now, in addition to the burning.
TrainSen	10000	 Why do I get so tired here?  True, I can probably sleep at any time, but I've noticed my desire to get to my bed as increased dramatically ever since I started school at UT.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe it's the so-called stress we just discussed in class today.
TrainSen	10000	 I was feeling pretty fit last week, maybe now I will get sick during Labor Day weekend.
TrainSen	10000	 Let's see.
TrainSen	10000	 six more minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 Sorry, but I am counting down.
TrainSen	10000	 Who knew twenty minutes was so interminably long?  I like using big words, it makes me feel so intelligent.
TrainSen	10000	 I know that's immature to think, but I really am just a child inside, filled with all the normal childish feelings of wonder and happiness and petty jealousy.
TrainSen	10000	 Yes, petty jealousy.
TrainSen	10000	 Like my jealousy toward all the pretty girls on campus, many of whom are my friends, which makes me feel all the worse, because aren't you supposed to not have bad feelings about your friends?  But I suppose that wouldn't be human.
TrainSen	10000	 But guilt is a totally human feeling as well, so I will continue feeling that.
TrainSen	10000	 Sometimes I wish I was my puppy, Ginger, with my biggest worry being that I'll see my own reflection on a window.
TrainSen	10000	 Did you know that dogs sleep about 18 hours every day?  I would kill for such a luxury.
TrainSen	10000	 Even when I'm retired, I doubt I'll receive such a luxury.
TrainSen	10000	 I can feel the keys of the laptop getting warm.
TrainSen	10000	 Or perhaps they were already warm.
TrainSen	10000	 who knows.
TrainSen	10000	 I definitely don't.
TrainSen	10000	 Sorry, but seeing as how I only have about two minutes left, what will follow will probably be nonsensical gibberish that I'm typing for the sole purpose of taking up time.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to go to sleep.
TrainSen	10000	 But no, it's only six in the evening.
TrainSen	10000	 Six!  It's like time moves at a slow-warped speed here.
TrainSen	10000	 Isn't it supposed to be bedtime?  I want to sleep.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to sleep.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to sleep.
TrainSen	10000	 and dream.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I could remember my dreams better, or that someone could analyze my dreams.
TrainSen	10000	 Or maybe I don't want that.
TrainSen	10000	 Who knows what would turn up.
TrainSen	00001	Good Morning.
TrainSen	00001	 Eventhough it's 12:30pm that is still morning in college hours.
TrainSen	00001	 They say you need a minimum of 8hours at my age, but I feel ten is a little more at par.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm trying to wake up so the music of the late Elliott Smith, a quiet honest indie-rock musician but my roommates won't turn down the overwhleming bass of whatever it is they're listening to.
TrainSen	00001	 It's kind of frusterating but after it's all dried up, I don't think I could have got  better roommates.
TrainSen	00001	 I love sitting at my laptop when I wake up like this with the curtains open letting the austin sun flood in like a warm bath.
TrainSen	00001	 Our apartment is a hellhole after weekends of careless partying.
TrainSen	00001	 It's absurd really.
TrainSen	00001	 So monday night I found out from some of my friends in College Station that my girlfriend, or x-girlfriend, has already been cheating on me there.
TrainSen	00001	 Damn Aggies.
TrainSen	00001	 can't live with them, can't kill them.
TrainSen	00001	 It's a cruel world.
TrainSen	00001	 But I'll be better off without her I think.
TrainSen	00001	 I talk to my brother about the experience, the unforgettable feeling of a broken heart.
TrainSen	00001	 Where everythought of the person, especially with someone else, makes you want to vomit.
TrainSen	00001	 But you still want to kiss them, even though they just kissed you with a boot to the face.
TrainSen	00001	 But I suppose it's like Morgan Freeman says in the movie Seven, ""love costs, it takes effort.
TrainSen	00001	 "" That's true.
TrainSen	00001	 Back to my brother, he has been through this experience more times than anyone person deserves.
TrainSen	00001	 He told me the trick is to realize that you are better off, in most cases.
TrainSen	00001	 For instance Alyssa, my x, was beautiful no doubt.
TrainSen	00001	 God she was gorgeous, which always made me wonder what she saw in a low-down dead-beat like your author.
TrainSen	00001	 But she has no conscious knowledge of art.
TrainSen	00001	 Ignorance isn't the problem, she just doesn't care about things beyond looks, impression and money.
TrainSen	00001	 And well obviously she doesn't know what ""love"" really is.
TrainSen	00001	 But then again maybe I don't either.
TrainSen	00001	 But I know I loved her, I believed her lies.
TrainSen	00001	 I bought the  false love she was selling for cheap.
TrainSen	00001	 I still love her I suppose, I can't deny it.
TrainSen	00001	 But she loved herself, before she loved me.
TrainSen	00001	 And now I have to do the same.
TrainSen	00001	 I have to be strong and let time heal all.
TrainSen	00001	 Another thing  my brother said was how she didn't have that one thing.
TrainSen	00001	 Like I was talking about her lack of care for art, and the beautiful small idiosyncracies of life.
TrainSen	00001	 She had beauty, she had the ability to kill me with her eyes and her smile, but she lacked that one thing.
TrainSen	00001	 And I quote Ben Harper, ""So many people to love in my life, why do I worry about one?"" I know there are better people out there so.
TrainSen	00001	 And I have to be the nicest cheated on boyfriend ever.
TrainSen	00001	 I honestly felt bad after I chewed her out and she was crying.
TrainSen	00001	 Try and figure that one out.
TrainSen	00001	 I suppose I'm just the nice guy that they say finishes last.
TrainSen	00001	 But I don't believe that saying.
TrainSen	00001	 Nice guys don't finish last, they just get shit on until they get the best in the end.
TrainSen	00001	 I believe that if you hold out, if you stand true to yourself while still remain vulnerable to the love others have to offer, you will find them.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm glad I don't have class today, makes it much easier to relax, despite the fact how much I enjoy college compared to high school.
TrainSen	00001	 High school, what a joke.
TrainSen	00001	 You are not pushed, you are not inspired.
TrainSen	00001	 In high school, you are simply encouraged to be another sheep in the herd.
TrainSen	00001	 To conform and be normal.
TrainSen	00001	 I always saw high school as a factory for the confused and dilusionary youth of our country.
TrainSen	00001	 But then again I am just one person.
TrainSen	00001	 So I try to go out there, find small things to make me happy, if only temporarily to just get by.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess that's my motive for life, for living happily and in peace.
TrainSen	00001	 I try to never get out a high horse of beliefs or opinions.
TrainSen	00001	 I think sometimes it's good to be apathetic and passive, and other times it is not.
TrainSen	00001	 For instance, your friend wants to smoke a cigarette in your car.
TrainSen	00001	 Just relax and roll down the windows and cruise.
TrainSen	00001	 But if your friend refuses to vote when he is done with that cigarette, that is unacceptable.
TrainSen	00001	 It's sad when people don't care important issues.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I just think too many people care too much about insignifigant issues, when the yard needs to be mowed or who won american idol, and too little about the major issues, war, politics, etc.
TrainSen	00001	 I think life is a crazy thing.
TrainSen	00001	 A conitinuous expanse of consciousness and action.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that maybe one day, I'll have all the answer, and then I will die.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe  one day I will find a love that is true.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I think too much.
TrainSen	10000	     I am sitting in my room.
TrainSen	10000	 There is tile being laid in the bathroom next to me.
TrainSen	10000	 The sound of musics floats in from the next room.
TrainSen	10000	 Paint smells intoxicate me.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel slightly light headed as I have for the past several days in my apartment.
TrainSen	10000	 The sound of the modem next to the computer begins to hum as if it is heating up.
TrainSen	10000	 My mama walks in the room and looks annoyed as the desk she trying to put together is not working according to her plan.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder whey she looks so upset about it.
TrainSen	10000	 The air conditioner begins to run.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a book for my government class lying open on the floor.
TrainSen	10000	 Who would have known that there would be that much reading for one class.
TrainSen	10000	 I cannot tell if I want to finish reading it or try and take notes from class for it to make sense.
TrainSen	10000	 The phone rings next to me.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't pick it up because I am worried I have waited too long to finish this assignment and I won't get full credit.
TrainSen	10000	 I fell asleep reading earlier this afternoon and just woke up.
TrainSen	10000	 Funny how the time just slips away like that.
TrainSen	10000	 You are payiong attention to everything around you one minute and the next it is gone.
TrainSen	10000	 You wake up and can't remember when you fell asleep the time before right now.
TrainSen	10000	 My nose starts to itch which is funny,because it isn't even dusty in my apartment right now.
TrainSen	10000	 The green wall of my bedroom is making the setting sunlight a strange color on my feet.
TrainSen	10000	 They look a weird yellow color as if they are becoming infected with something.
TrainSen	10000	 It makes my sheets look pretty though.
TrainSen	10000	 The mixture of green, yellow, and purple reminds me of a rainbow.
TrainSen	10000	 Everything is starting to fade.
TrainSen	10000	 My mind and eyes start to slow down.
TrainSen	10000	 Everyone around me is moving too fast for my taste.
TrainSen	10000	 I want it to slow down.
TrainSen	10000	 Everything should be slower these days.
TrainSen	10000	 I like it when it is lazy like on Sundays.
TrainSen	10000	 I watch TV until I feel like eating something.
TrainSen	10000	 I can smell my mama start to cook dinner.
TrainSen	10000	 She always makes such good food for me.
TrainSen	10000	 I smell cheese melting on something.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it might be broccoli.
TrainSen	10000	 But you can't smell brocolli.
TrainSen	10000	 I keep spelling that differently.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder how it is supposed to be spelled.
TrainSen	10000	 How funny.
TrainSen	10000	 Things like that when they happen.
TrainSen	10000	 LIke when you can't remember how to spell and or something easy like that.
TrainSen	10000	 I realized I haven't typed for the whole 20 minutes right now, but I have to have it in by five.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I will try to do it again in a minute.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope this isn't too bad.
TrainSen	10000	     I guess  I will talk about the guy I was dating before I came here, since I just got off the phone with him before I got on the computer to complete this assignment.
TrainSen	10000	 After dating him for two months I realized relationships differ greatly from person to person.
TrainSen	10000	 There are no straight rules to follow.
TrainSen	10000	 Everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them.
TrainSen	10000	 At first I was so confused by this guy  because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did.
TrainSen	10000	 After just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that is weird.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them.
TrainSen	10000	 I still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but I am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact.
TrainSen	10000	 I had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work.
TrainSen	10000	 I was thinking I could never do that.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact.
TrainSen	10000	 Because I believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and I are not together.
TrainSen	10000	 I thinkI'm still new to the dating thing because I don't understand it.
TrainSen	10000	 I try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is.
TrainSen	10000	 I have mostly dated older people.
TrainSen	10000	 My first real boyfriend was seven years older than I.
TrainSen	10000	 That relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than I was.
TrainSen	10000	 His majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did.
TrainSen	10000	 I think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot.
TrainSen	10000	 After breaking up with him I felt I needed a boyfriend and I even felt a little lonely.
TrainSen	10000	 Now I am fine and mostly dated for fun I guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid.
TrainSen	10000	 I gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others I find attractive or of high standing and what I don't want my future husband to have one day.
TrainSen	10000	 Not to say I am definitly marrying someone but I hope I will find that right someone.
TrainSen	10000	 For right now though I am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before I ever get married I want to have finished school for my own personal goal.
TrainSen	10000	 You can't always rely on others in life so if I get a good education I can get a good job to support myself.
TrainSen	10000	 This has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else.
TrainSen	10000	 Because that someone else might not always be there.
TrainSen	10000	 This has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what I was thinking about.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel confused by relationships and I guess I should be and I am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well.
TrainSen	10000	 I just hope everything will work in the long run and so I'll try not to worry about because I used to worry about things to much that I would stress my self out.
TrainSen	00001	It seems like everyone has gone home for Labor Day weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 Lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good.
TrainSen	00001	 We had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes.
TrainSen	00001	 I really don't normally like mashed potatoes but I always just get them anyway.
TrainSen	00001	 A couple people started playing Coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key.
TrainSen	00001	 Procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class.
TrainSen	00001	 The more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be.
TrainSen	00001	 This dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us.
TrainSen	00001	 At night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance.
TrainSen	00001	 They tend to yell and be extremely loud.
TrainSen	00001	 Our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow.
TrainSen	00001	 It would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off.
TrainSen	00001	 There are so many more months before the semester is over!  I'm sure it will go quickly though.
TrainSen	00001	 Twenty minutes seems like a long time right now.
TrainSen	00001	 I still have to go to Wal-Mart today because we're completely out of snacks in the room.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me.
TrainSen	00001	 Our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch.
TrainSen	00001	 I've been watching way too much of ""The Real World"" in the past two days.
TrainSen	00001	 They've been playing reruns nonstop since like Wednesday.
TrainSen	00001	 This week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because Monday and Wednesday are my busy days.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to get out of the city next weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I'll go visit some friends at Texas State or go to the lake.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't been swimming in really long time.
TrainSen	00001	 I remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than I remember swimming in my own pool.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time.
TrainSen	00001	 Our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make.
TrainSen	00001	 The trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but I never once got stung.
TrainSen	00001	 The lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out.
TrainSen	00001	 Well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because I'm over half way done.
TrainSen	00001	 The game on Saturday was really fun.
TrainSen	00001	 Once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable.
TrainSen	00001	 UNT didn't do very well.
TrainSen	00001	 I almost went there instead of UT just because its close to home and my sisters went there.
TrainSen	00001	 On the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know why I bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when I have a computer sitting right in front of me.
TrainSen	00001	 Its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book.
TrainSen	00001	 I hear a lawnmower outside.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on Labor Day.
TrainSen	00001	 My neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long.
TrainSen	00001	 I should trim my fingernails.
TrainSen	00001	 They keep getting in the way while I'm typing.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't seem a movie since I came to Austin.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't even know where a movie theater is around here.
TrainSen	00001	 Better yet, I don't know what is playing right now.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't seen any previews either.
TrainSen	00001	 Someone must be sick because I keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway.
TrainSen	00001	 People go out way too much.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't go out on a school night without feeling badly.
TrainSen	00001	 I always want to wait for the weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm sure that will change shortly though.
TrainSen	00001	 This has been a very long weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 I  think I'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.
TrainSen	00010	well I guess it'll be good to get this out of the way.
TrainSen	00010	 Let's see what's on my mind.
TrainSen	00010	 ok I think I need to turn off the TV and maybe turn on a little music.
TrainSen	00010	 this seems like it could get boring.
TrainSen	00010	 hmm.
TrainSen	00010	 maybe that's a bad sign that I think my thoughts are goig to be boring.
TrainSen	00010	 anyway, all right, the tv's off and now the musics on.
TrainSen	00010	 much better.
TrainSen	00010	 well I'm officially pledging phi delt tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm going to be assigned my big brother at the meeting this evening and I'm pretty excited.
TrainSen	00010	 I think this is going to be a lot of fun.
TrainSen	00010	 john's pledging with me and I guess we're going to get to be pretty good friends.
TrainSen	00010	 this is kind of nice.
TrainSen	00010	 this is a good way to clear my thoughts up.
TrainSen	00010	 I've heard before that writing out everything makes you slow your thoughts to the pace of writing and it's an effective way to clear your head.
TrainSen	00010	 what kind of phrase is that.
TrainSen	00010	 clear your head? that's a weird thing when you actually think about it.
TrainSen	00010	 ok I can't talk about one thing for very long.
TrainSen	00010	 wow this time is going pretty fast.
TrainSen	00010	 it doesn't seem like I've been writing long at all and I'm a quarter of the way done.
TrainSen	00010	 ok well let's accomplish something productive here.
TrainSen	00010	 what do I need to do today? I need to get khakis and a white shirt for tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 hmm I wonder what I should do about shoes.
TrainSen	00010	 I didn't bring my dress shoes I don't think.
TrainSen	00010	 that's one bad thing about being 8 hours from home.
TrainSen	00010	 when I remember something that I forgot to bring, or didn't think I would need, there's not much I can do about it.
TrainSen	00010	 ok what else do I need to do today.
TrainSen	00010	 its labor day.
TrainSen	00010	 I like not having class.
TrainSen	00010	 umm ok think, I need to study chapter 5 in biology.
TrainSen	00010	 really I need to review all of the chapters that's got to be my biggest priority today.
TrainSen	00010	 and I need to finish reading my psych chapters and philosophy stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like I always  have something to do.
TrainSen	00010	 it was this way in high school too though so I guess its not that bad.
TrainSen	00010	 there's a guy pledging with me that reminds of somebody famous but I can't place it.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think I've ever heard this song but I know the band.
TrainSen	00010	 that's not saying much for the band.
TrainSen	00010	 or maybe it is.
TrainSen	00010	 either they have a unique sound or all of their songs sound too much alike.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know which it is in this case.
TrainSen	00010	 maybe a little of both.
TrainSen	00010	 ok the time is not going as quickly as I thought it was.
TrainSen	00010	 do I have anything else to do today? clothes, read, umm I've talked to my mom today about everything I think I needed to tell her.
TrainSen	00010	 I paid my stupid parking ticket.
TrainSen	00010	 there's 40 bucks wasted on me stupidity.
TrainSen	00010	 I thought about appealing it but they called out my exact reason for the appeal on ""reasons not to appeal your ticket"" apparently just being a dumbass isn't a valid reason.
TrainSen	00010	 I love this song.
TrainSen	00010	 barenaked ladies are a good band.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to see them in concert again.
TrainSen	00010	 oh concert.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't wait for the acl festival coming up.
TrainSen	00010	 and next weekend I'm going to mexico with the phi delts.
TrainSen	00010	 oh this is going to be a lot of fun.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm excited for so many things this semester.
TrainSen	00010	 I just need to make sure I keep my grades up and everything.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm sure I will.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't forsee myself slacking off at all.
TrainSen	00010	 if I want to get into medical school I need to have the best grades possible.
TrainSen	00010	 but then I don't know if I really want to go to medical school.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to talk to an advisor about this stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 hopefully I can get into my fig advisor tomorrow and see what he has to say.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't decide if I want to major in neurobiology or switch to liberal arts and look into psychology.
TrainSen	00010	 I think this is a really interesting field but at the same time I feel like its uhhh I lost my train of thought.
TrainSen	00010	 lets see.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like its umm something that too many people do.
TrainSen	00010	 its over done as a major I guess I don't really know what word to use to describe it.
TrainSen	00010	 woo! one minute remaining.
TrainSen	00010	 umm so yeah psychology is really interesting.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm actually not dreading reading the rest of the chapters.
TrainSen	00010	 in fact I'm kind of looking forward to it.
TrainSen	00010	 ok well the times up I guess I'll quit now.
TrainSen	00010	 that was fun.
TrainSen	01000	so this is the first entry, and it happens to fall on a day when things are really.
TrainSen	01000	 Shitty.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know if I have the desire to join the rowing team, though I've already told everyone that I was going to; my internet connection was messing with my earlier, a reason to cry in itself; my relationship with a boy I don't know enough about.
TrainSen	01000	 Lets start with that.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been dating him for about a year and a half, and I don't know who he is.
TrainSen	01000	 will he cheat on me?  is my relationship anything to be worried about?  if a stranger looked into our lives, would he giggle, surprised at the immaturity of our  relationship?  is it anything to try to save?  I hope so, if not I'm a fool.
TrainSen	01000	 but I think I'm one anyway.
TrainSen	01000	 but paul henry, he knows his shit, it seems.
TrainSen	01000	 or its that he knows that he doesn't know his shit.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I knew.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I knew him as well.
TrainSen	01000	 though his devotion is something that would automatically clash with me.
TrainSen	01000	 I have nothing against christians or their beliefs.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I could give myself up to that with no regrets.
TrainSen	01000	 But I can't.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been down that road, and its lead nowhere.
TrainSen	01000	 have I spoiled my chances with a true love by being with brian?  will I ever be content in my own two damn shoes?  will I ever feel like I'm at home? will I be successful?  would I be happy without success?  it seems like the lives people live are all too perfect, even the less desireable, that there's some author out there, other than someones god, writing the stories of our lives.
TrainSen	01000	 but he forgot me?  why am I not going anywhere, why can't I find this happiness and joy.
TrainSen	01000	 my life is pathetic at this point.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe its just this horrible attitude, but the only time I feel like I can be happy (or at least not pissed off) is with brian, laying in his bed, thinking of everything and nothing all at the same time.
TrainSen	01000	 but how does this conflict so much with the previous statements?? it would seem that I am happy with him, but then comes the doubt and fears.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to find myself, I say.
TrainSen	01000	 only thing is.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know what that means.
TrainSen	01000	 does anyone? its really this unattainable goal people teasing set in your minds.
TrainSen	01000	 A state you need to obtain, but its in fact unattainable.
TrainSen	01000	 the sad bastards who were told the same thing when they were younger are enraged that they don't know how to go about it, and they then ruin the lives of everyone after them, so they can suffer justly.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I were born in the old days, when you died of a flu and there wasn't such a thing as AIDS.
TrainSen	01000	 people lived lightly, they wrote, they read, sometimes found something to revolutionize, but mostly enjoyed the simplicity of life.
TrainSen	01000	 where did that virtue go?  how has it managed to slip through the fingers of time, and where would it have gone?  I wish I could sift through the ashes of our charred world, seeking only the beauty and peace that once was everywhere, but now seems like you have to search for only to get the smallest glimpse of it.
TrainSen	01000	 how come I can't be a writer?  how come I can't write?  I want to study people, not medicine.
TrainSen	01000	 why would I declare this major?  if I studied other peoples lives all the time, would I have a life of my own?  is true adulthood worth it?  people always want what they can't get.
TrainSen	01000	 I get what I don't want.
TrainSen	01000	 everything always seems like it gets really good, I mean reaaaally good, right when its about to end.
TrainSen	01000	 will college be like this?  will life itself be like this?  will I stop asking so many damn questions??  will he call?  would I want him to? I don't want this life.
TrainSen	01000	 anyone want to trade?  I want a life of the storybooks, of unquestionable love, faith and virtue.
TrainSen	01000	 knowledge, hope, and an impeccable body would be nice too.
TrainSen	01000	 I want all the money in the world, I want to live in a time without money.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to be a movie critic, I hate bad actresses with hair that doesn't fit their character.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate living with someone other than who I love.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate not knowing if its really the true love they talk about.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate being inadequate, I hate second guessing everyone.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate being critical.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate chocolate chips.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate gaining weight.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate stretchy jeans that don't look good.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate running out of time, I hate trying to fill time.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope this class makes me realize a few things about myself, although I'm not sure why it would.
TrainSen	01000	 Seven six five four three two one.
TrainSen	10000	     I love my girlfriend leah.
TrainSen	10000	 She is so awesome.
TrainSen	10000	 I love her big butt and her hair, I love her tongue and her smile.
TrainSen	10000	 Man oh man does she give good hand jobs.
TrainSen	10000	 Almost as good as sex.
TrainSen	10000	 ALMOST.
TrainSen	10000	 there are some things I don't like about her though.
TrainSen	10000	 She is a tiny bit chubby but it doesn't really bother me that much.
TrainSen	10000	 She is stubborn and that at times gets on my nerves.
TrainSen	10000	 I also worry that she is a shopaholic.
TrainSen	10000	 and that if we do get married one day that she will spend too much of our income.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder what I will be doing 5 years from now.
TrainSen	10000	 it would be so awesome to be a country music station radio dj.
TrainSen	10000	 I think the prime time for me would have to be like at lunch time.
TrainSen	10000	 I believe that would be best, cause then I could stay up late still and sleep in a little later.
TrainSen	10000	 the rush hour traffic time would be awesome too.
TrainSen	10000	 I would have fun being the dj in the morning, but I would hate the hours.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean whoa, not my kind of lifestyle.
TrainSen	10000	 I also wonder if being a personal trainer is going to work out.
TrainSen	10000	 I haven't been really an active gym goer.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to start doing that.
TrainSen	10000	 I am trying to think of what would be a good time to go.
TrainSen	10000	 on mondays I could go right after class at 5, same thing goes for wednesdays.
TrainSen	10000	 on tuesdays, thursdays and fridays, I should probably go right after Spanish, because then after I am done I could go eat something, that would probably kill two birds with one stone because of the fact that I wouldn't have to eat before I go to Spanish then.
TrainSen	10000	 I could probably focus on cardio type stuff on monday, Wednesday and friday.
TrainSen	10000	 and then weight train on tuesday and Thursday.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe I should do the opposite.
TrainSen	10000	 cause then I could work my muscles more and they do say u lose weight by working out, plus on mondays and wednesdays it will be harder to do cardio at that time since it will be so crowded at that time.
TrainSen	10000	 now about tennis.
TrainSen	10000	 I really hope I can get to play on the real courts and not have to go to intermural courts just to practice.
TrainSen	10000	 I should go check that out tomorrow along with all the other things I need to do.
TrainSen	10000	 it would be cool if leah and sara came to UT next year, unfortunetly I don't see that happening when it comes to leah.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder how long I should wait before proposing.
TrainSen	10000	 I think waiting til at least my junior year would be best.
TrainSen	10000	 because then at least my parents will see that we are in a serious relationship.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean two years is a long time to be with someone, and it was about that same time amber and jeff were together.
TrainSen	10000	 no wait they were actually 3.
TrainSen	10000	 5 years I think, maybe 2.
TrainSen	10000	 5 when he asked and 3.
TrainSen	10000	 5 before marriage, I don't know, whatever it is.
TrainSen	10000	 the only question is that when we are married what will we first do for money.
TrainSen	10000	 I could probably go back to HEB cause I mean they don't pay that poorly.
TrainSen	10000	 possibly even be a CCM or something so that I could bring a little extra dough in.
TrainSen	10000	 I would try hard to at least get a job at a radio station.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder how long u have to work at one before they give u your own show.
TrainSen	10000	 I should also go to the radio station tomorrow to see if I could get some kind of spot in there.
TrainSen	10000	 even if it wasn't a show, but a technical thing.
TrainSen	10000	 okay so when it comes to homework what should I do so that I have somewhat of a schedule.
TrainSen	10000	 if I sleep in the mornings, or at least plan to, I don't think I should try scheduling that in.
TrainSen	10000	 what I should probably try to do is try to be strict to making sure I get hw done first before I do anything else.
TrainSen	10000	 because then I could go to sleep sooner too and then maybe this job wouldn't be too bad.
TrainSen	10000	 cause that's probably my problem, the fact that I don't go to sleep early enough.
TrainSen	10000	 I want to go to midnight rodeo this Saturday, I just wish roger creager wasn't playing there.
TrainSen	10000	 remember to call leah tomorrow to tell her mom about staying out later.
TrainSen	10000	 back to study.
TrainSen	10000	 monday and wednesdays should be too bad hw wise becuase all I have is my writing class EASY, and Spanish, so getting out late on those days isn't too bad.
TrainSen	10000	 Tuesdays and thursdays I should try to make sure I am done with hw by like 6, cause then I could go eat after I did my hw.
TrainSen	10000	 that's a pretty good plan.
TrainSen	10000	 only on occasions should I change that up.
TrainSen	10000	 what I mean by that is like being invited to do stuff, never let it be online poker or TV that distracts me, that includes playing xbox.
TrainSen	10000	 even if I think I have had a hard day so far, just think how more satisfying that resting will be once I have everything done, I mean knowing u don't have anything left to do is a nice feeling.
TrainSen	10000	 this writing this is going by faster than I thought.
TrainSen	10000	 I didn't know I had all this stuff on my mind.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it would be nice to have a 6pac on my body, and some muscle.
TrainSen	10000	 you know, it really does kind of upset me that leah doesn't want me hanging out with females alone.
TrainSen	10000	 I find that it shouldn't matter.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean on one hand I know her past, and I don't want to upset her on something as small as this, but on the other hand it is kind of a big deal.
TrainSen	10000	 maybe I should talk with her again and we could go more in depth or even set up some ground rules about this.
TrainSen	10000	 HOPEFULLY we can compromise.
TrainSen	10000	 I am kind of tired but I really do need to study for Spanish quizzes tomorrow, and I should look over chapter 4 for this class.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder when the first test is, I think it is on the 20th.
TrainSen	10000	 that's coming up pretty soon.
TrainSen	10000	 I should look at that handbook thing I have on sample test questions on this friday.
TrainSen	10000	 along with that I could reread philosophy and study some more Spanish, and go to a seminar for writing class.
TrainSen	10000	 this was kind of a fun thing to do.
TrainSen	10000	 I kind of like having a diary like this, helps me think clearly.
TrainSen	00001	     Right now I am realli thinkingabout buying a soccerball so that I can starttraining because I really want to join a soccer team.
TrainSen	00001	 I did not go to the gyn todayso I thing I'l go tomorrow.
TrainSen	00001	 My CD of the soundtrack of Queen of the Damn is one of the best CD's I have ever heard.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to get a laptop ecause everyday I have more and more homework like whatI am doing right now and my chemistry homework which I also have to do online.
TrainSen	00001	 I do not knw why I feel so tired.
TrainSen	00001	 I think its because I am having too much homework.
TrainSen	00001	 I really do not like the hot weather.
TrainSen	00001	 I prefer winter over any other season in the year only because I like the gloomy and quiet weather.
TrainSen	00001	 I am already getting tired of writing and I think I am going to go to sleep early today so that tomrrow I can go to the Gym and still not be so tired as today so that I can do more homework.
TrainSen	00001	 I really miss all my family.
TrainSen	00001	 I am so used to a lot of noise and laughter since I have two brothers and two sisters.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss playing with my baby sister who is only three years old.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to finish this so that I can start playing my favorite game, ""The king of fighters.
TrainSen	00001	 "" Oh I almost forgot I need to call my family because I told my dad I was going to call them yesterday but I didn't.
TrainSen	00001	 I am hungry.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to go to sleep.
TrainSen	00001	 I realy do believe there exists other civilizations in our galaxy.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't gethow so many people can go to church every sunday and even n otherdays of the week.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm tired of sittinglike this.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to get a chair or my back is going to start hurting.
TrainSen	00001	 The lyrics from the CD ""Jaguares"" are so amazing.
TrainSen	00001	 It really helps me to listen to these lyrics because they talk about different aspects of life and the mind.
TrainSen	00001	 If I was to chance my major I would change it to Aerospace Enineering because  love everything that has to do with airplanes.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I am.
TrainSen	10000	     Oh man I'm so hungry.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't wait for the football game tonight, it's going to be lots of fun.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, I think really fast, cause I'm so thinking about 3 things at once.
TrainSen	10000	 Hunger, football, and the giant pre-screening survey thing that I just took.
TrainSen	10000	 Can you believe that I finished it at 2:54, only 6 minutes left before they stopped accepting them.
TrainSen	10000	 Man talking about some pressure.
TrainSen	10000	 Speaking of pressure, I just thought of physics, which is kind of weird since I don't have physics this year.
TrainSen	10000	 I do have math though.
TrainSen	10000	 I played cards last time I was in class.
TrainSen	10000	 We played this crazy Russian game.
TrainSen	10000	 It was really cool.
TrainSen	10000	 We tied in the end.
TrainSen	10000	 ^_^ Wow, ok, so now that I typed ^_^, I thought of anime and forums since I use that on forums all the time, and it's an anime face.
TrainSen	10000	 And now I'm thinking about how I can type without looking at the keyboard.
TrainSen	10000	 I just moved the mouse, and that reminded me of a real mouse.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I make a lot of typos.
TrainSen	10000	 Of well, did you know that I learned to type too early that I lifted my hands off the keyboard so I could type faster since, I had small hands.
TrainSen	10000	 And so in I think 10th grade I had to fix myself, and retaught myself 10 finger typing.
TrainSen	10000	 Cause you see this ""hover hands"" typing caused me to look at the keyboard.
TrainSen	10000	 The song just changed and it totaly distracted me.
TrainSen	10000	 Speaking on Song, I met a girl named Helen Song, the first Day of Psycology and she's really cool.
TrainSen	10000	 I like her a lot as a friend but at the same time I want to ask her out.
TrainSen	10000	 But you know that my biggest fear (and pretty much the only one) is losing a friend.
TrainSen	10000	 And so I have trouble asking girls out cause I'm afraid after they say no, that they don't want to be friends anymore.
TrainSen	10000	 Why am I telling you this.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well, for all I know you don't read these, or you read them completely.
TrainSen	10000	 Hehe, you know why do some people type hehe, and other haha.
TrainSen	10000	 You told us to think about our reactions and our observations.
TrainSen	10000	 I bet lots of people start talking about what their observing and rather than thinking, pay more attention to their random observation thoughts.
TrainSen	10000	 I bet that produces a lot of weird data.
TrainSen	10000	 Me, well I ask a lot of questions, and think really fast.
TrainSen	10000	 I often find myself daydreaming.
TrainSen	10000	 ALL THE TIME! hehe.
TrainSen	10000	 so yeah, wow, hehe sounds like a girl to me.
TrainSen	10000	 Not to self, refrain from saying hehe.
TrainSen	10000	 I glanced at the clock for the first time.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder is that means that I'm finally bored after 8:30 minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 But as I keep typing, huh, I thinking more about the actual act of typing.
TrainSen	10000	 I just looked at the title, ""Stream of Consciousness of Writing"" but now the music changed to a good song so I'm distracted from that last thought.
TrainSen	10000	 This song is good.
TrainSen	10000	 It's techno.
TrainSen	10000	 I know that I listed to it cause it matches my lifestyle, fastpassed? wow, I can't spell.
TrainSen	10000	 So yeah, my SAT score was 580 reading and 780 math.
TrainSen	10000	 That's just a little weighed don't you think ^_^.
TrainSen	10000	 There it is again.
TrainSen	10000	 I just though of the entire universe and big guns, and planets and spaceships, this is going by way faster than I can type, but trust me that I'm having a ball here.
TrainSen	10000	 Soccer, now that I haven't played in a while, and I just started playing tennis.
TrainSen	10000	 That was tiring, but I want to work to be the best.
TrainSen	10000	 StarCraft, and my daydream story just came into my mind.
TrainSen	10000	 You see in order to pass the time I come up with a story and slowly play it out in my head with extreme detail.
TrainSen	10000	 A single day dream could take up to month to complete, as I start and stop it when neccissary.
TrainSen	10000	 Man, I'm getting excited about football.
TrainSen	10000	 You know I've never seen a whole football game before.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm sweating, maybe I should go turn down the AC, neh, that's my mom's domain, and well I don't want to stop typing.
TrainSen	10000	 What only 6 minutes left, Well I suppose that means 75% of the time has passed.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder why I converted this into a percentage.
TrainSen	10000	 That's really weird you know.
TrainSen	10000	 Talk, that's what my phone said, cause it didn't ring, huh, strange, why would I type that.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that means I'm focussing too much on typing and not enough on other events, although I suppose it really doesn't matter does it.
TrainSen	10000	 But as I progress I think more and more about my typing.
TrainSen	10000	 So do you know javascript, did you create that timer, or did you 'steal' the code for it, and use it on you site.
TrainSen	10000	 I hadn't noticed this song was annoying till now.
TrainSen	10000	 I normally listen to music when on my computer, you know like browsing the web, or photoshoping (digital image creation).
TrainSen	10000	 The only times I don't have it on is when I watch anime, or play a game.
TrainSen	10000	 Speaking of anime, I just finished watching wow ok like 5 titles flashed through my head.
TrainSen	10000	 Hellsing, that was the last one I watched.
TrainSen	10000	 You know I like anime much better than TV cause they can create a long drawn out plot which is infinitly better than a single 30 minute plot.
TrainSen	10000	 It's like watching a book rather than reading one.
TrainSen	10000	 Reading, the last thing I read was a StarCraft book, yeah it came from the game.
TrainSen	10000	 That's sad I know, but I just couldn't focus on Lord of the Rings you know.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder how much other people type, I mean, am I a fast typer.
TrainSen	10000	 The amount they turn in has to be due to the typing speed and not the thought speed let me tell you, cause we think incredibly fast.
TrainSen	01000	     Well, yesterday was a good day, that is until I spoke to my boyfriend on the phone.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I was being overly mean to him and we got in a big argument over nothing.
TrainSen	01000	 I was mad at him and then hung up with him, then I called to apologize and he was mad at me for being mad at him.
TrainSen	01000	 It was just one big drama over nothing.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I made him extra angry because he told me he needed to sleep it off otherwise he might say things he really didn't mean.
TrainSen	01000	 That ofcourse made me sad, because all I wanted to do was say sorry and just talk to him.
TrainSen	01000	 He is attending college at Texas State, the big party school, and I guess I'm just scared I'm going to lose him.
TrainSen	01000	 He's already been doing what that school is known for, boozing it up.
TrainSen	01000	 Although I haven't been with him for long, the connection we share is the best feeling I've felt in such a long time.
TrainSen	01000	 It makes me sad because I'm not sure if relationships like mine are meant to last.
TrainSen	01000	 I've never heard anything good about long distance relationships, and the more I think about it, the more I worry.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe that's why I was being rude to him.
TrainSen	01000	 My fears just come out in other ways.
TrainSen	01000	 It's so strange though because I know I can see him pretty much every weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm just so confused right now.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe I'm just stressed.
TrainSen	01000	 It is my first year of college and I'm expreiencing so many new things, including confusing lectures from professors.
TrainSen	01000	 I just want everything to be okay.
TrainSen	01000	 I want good grades.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to have fun.
TrainSen	01000	 And most of all I want to work things out with my boyfriend.
TrainSen	01000	 I felt like crying when I got off the phone with him last night, but I held back because I didn't want my room mate to thing anything was wrong.
TrainSen	01000	 When I think of my boyfriend I can only think of a future with him.
TrainSen	01000	 I've known him a lot longer than I've actually been with him, and it's not that he's just someone to kiss and hug, he's more of a best friend to me.
TrainSen	01000	 I know this may not last forever, and that's what makes my heart break.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm only 18.
TrainSen	01000	 What are the odds of he and I actually getting married, honestly? Then it makes me think why I even bother getting into relationships if they are just going to end? There really is no point.
TrainSen	01000	 On the other hand, I need to be with this boy.
TrainSen	01000	 Life just wouldn't be the same without him.
TrainSen	01000	 What to do? Maybe I'll just propose to him.
TrainSen	01000	 haha, yeah right.
TrainSen	01000	 I just want things to be okay.
TrainSen	01000	 I just want to be happy, and it seems he's one of the main reasons I am.
TrainSen	01000	 Grrr, all of this stuff doesn't even make any sense.
TrainSen	01000	 Anyhow, this writing assignment was really helpful.
TrainSen	01000	 Got some of my feelings out, and I've never said any of this stuff to anyone.
TrainSen	01000	 It was like a journal.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm glad I'm taking such a cool class.
TrainSen	10000	Autumn will be here soon.
TrainSen	10000	 I wake up, get myself together, look out the window at the morning roar of the bitter city.
TrainSen	10000	 Down.
TrainSen	10000	 Down the elivator once again, floor 13, now floor 1.
TrainSen	10000	 I step ouside and inhale, a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs.
TrainSen	10000	 This is where I realsize that everyday is but a breath.
TrainSen	10000	 That single inhale was a day, was a life.
TrainSen	10000	 Old postcards line my smile.
TrainSen	10000	 I am a story, and I tear up when I thumb through my dusty file cabnet of experiences.
TrainSen	10000	 My eyes desperately search for ideas, while I know they are all within some governing organ I possess.
TrainSen	10000	 Heart or head, it doesn't matter.
TrainSen	10000	 but I find it odd that my eyes do the searching.
TrainSen	10000	 My little fan is growling at me.
TrainSen	10000	 It's probably upset that I always leave it on.
TrainSen	10000	 Let me turn it off really quick.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok.
TrainSen	10000	 Done.
TrainSen	10000	 I heard a door shut.
TrainSen	10000	 The people in my dorm are an infestation.
TrainSen	10000	 I cannot STAND them.
TrainSen	10000	 I try so hard to see the good within everyone, but how can I if they are all the same.
TrainSen	10000	 Everyday I walk around the autumn grasping campus and I look.
TrainSen	10000	 Look at people, the sky, the earth, the buildings.
TrainSen	10000	 but the people.
TrainSen	10000	 I LOOK at the people.
TrainSen	10000	 They make me laugh! We are so strange.
TrainSen	10000	 I see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an iPod pumping sound into their skulls.
TrainSen	10000	 People who try to look sexy.
TrainSen	10000	 People who look mad at the world, and sneer at you, the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance.
TrainSen	10000	 People look at me too.
TrainSen	10000	 What is it that I possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine.
TrainSen	10000	 My heart races when they do that.
TrainSen	10000	 It's kind of a love.
TrainSen	10000	 I love them for that one milisecond.
TrainSen	10000	 I understand them for one lapse of time.
TrainSen	10000	 But did they look at me because I was looking toward them? Am I attractive to them? Am I mysterious? Scary? Sexy? Sometimes people LOOK at me.
TrainSen	10000	 That's my job.
TrainSen	10000	 I absolutely hate being in here.
TrainSen	10000	 Trapped between machine and the cement walls around me.
TrainSen	10000	 I cannot stand the fact that our society is ruled by technology and media.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't watch TV, I don't keep up with any news, I listen to music and read books.
TrainSen	10000	 entertainment is all I need on media terms.
TrainSen	10000	 We should kill our TV's though.
TrainSen	10000	 As one of my favorite bands says ""I wish the world was flat like the old days"".
TrainSen	10000	 I have to say: Amen.
TrainSen	10000	 We need to evolve backwards! We need to get back to the old way of life, religion, and appreciate the earth and sky, appreciate our unique existence in the universe.
TrainSen	10000	 We need to notice our equality before we notice the differences.
TrainSen	10000	 But, I suppose it's just wishfull thinking.
TrainSen	01000	I'm thinking about if I am going to get the job that I want at the PAC at the university it would suck if I didn't I am proud that the OTC called me for a job interview, they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like I didn't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so I can't type as fast and I keep having to go back and erase but I like pressure I thrive under it but I don't like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words I do not like those because I am so used to using slang that I just do not type it anymore and I also hate having to capitalize my I's it makes me mad having to go back.
TrainSen	01000	 Right now I feel a little stress because I am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday I had a meeting and I did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all I could read was Biology which is another class I don't understand I never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either I feel lost in that class it is so difficult I feel like I dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not I just keep thinking about what Prof.
TrainSen	01000	 Pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel.
TrainSen	01000	 Like screaming I guess but the Professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home I had a divided keyboard the ""flowy"" ones and now I have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment I like but I feel like I shouldn't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid I's and I forgort to put and apostrophe in shouldn't and the I messed me up again.
TrainSen	01000	 Well forget it no more caps; the I's are going to be in lower case.
TrainSen	01000	 Sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit I need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend I get to go home though I want to go to the game I have not boguht the sports package and I didn't feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot I guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy's a football player so I feel like I should go for him but I'm not going.
TrainSen	01000	 Now I get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe I'll get sick when I go home like Prof.
TrainSen	01000	 Pennebaker said probably because I feel the migrane coming.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate migranes I hate having to find a job hopefully I get a good one I have an interview on Tuesday I hope it goes well and that I make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how the bus works I keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause I have seen it once after running to the engineering building because I was late I saw the bus and I think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but I will take a look around and see if that's how it works.
TrainSen	01000	 Now I feel like I have run out of things to say I still have to do the experiment for this class I want to do the survey but since I am under 18 I have to get my moms signature and I feel like I should be happy about going home I mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like ""huh"" and I hope nothings happens like the bus doesn't break down or like it is ""kidnapped' I know I worry too much but I don't want anything to happen even if it means that I have to do all the homework, I've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys, and what was I talking about I don't kno, I need to make friends me and my roommate get along but I need other friends and now I have 5 minutes left, what to write about anyways back to the making friends I saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart Asian in the elevator today I feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that I have are okay but I don't really relate to them why I don't kno I feel like they exclude me too much and they don't at least I hope they don't and if they do I don't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still I have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really I am surprised I wrote this much I thought I was going to run out of this to say but I like this assignment when Prof.
TrainSen	01000	 Pennebaker said it I was like yes no grammar rules I don't particularly like grammar but I try I mean I suck at it in my papers I always score low on it 2 minutes and I have mentioned my time too many times I tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and I did nto so now I keep talking about NOT because I want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts I think it is the flourescent lighting I think that is how u spell that and I just put the letter u for the word you and I am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and I keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh I thought it was over but I am going to stop now because a I don't want to talk for too long and I have to go turn of this light and I am thinking about what I just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if I should put my name at the bottom but I won't because I have the code thing.
TrainSen	01000	 well this was productive and I did not put well in caps.
TrainSen	00001	     Well, I have to do this weird assignment for psychology.
TrainSen	00001	 I think its neat, but kind of weird.
TrainSen	00001	 that spoon full peanut butter was really good.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm going to have to have some more later.
TrainSen	00001	 the atkins diet is a bitch .
TrainSen	00001	 even though you can eat all the protein you want.
TrainSen	00001	 I still crave the bun on my buger.
TrainSen	00001	 I was so upset this morning for leaving my cell phone in my dorm room.
TrainSen	00001	 god, I felt like such an idiot.
TrainSen	00001	 then I went crazy looking for my  roommate Sam cause we are supposed to meet at jester for lunch and I Couldn't find her and I don't have her number memorized.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know.
TrainSen	00001	 I felt stupid.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel so fat.
TrainSen	00001	 !!!! even though I'm not overweight at all I just feel fat .
TrainSen	00001	 I have this obsession with looking in the mirror all the time.
TrainSen	00001	 I thinks obsessive compulsive or something.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel like I always have to look my best or that part of my hair is out of place.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I always feel like I have to impress everyone.
TrainSen	00001	 shut up Sam, god she makes the most annoying sounds I've ever heard.
TrainSen	00001	 anyway.
TrainSen	00001	 yeah I just always feel fat.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I way around 123 and I'm 5""1.
TrainSen	00001	 I just want be a little bit thinner maybe 5 or 7 pounds lighter.
TrainSen	00001	 well, I'm trying to loose weight cause my friends from back home are coming to visit me in a couple of weeks for austin city limits, and I feel like I got to loose a few.
TrainSen	00001	 they are awesome, but its kind of weird actually because they were my coaches in high school and we've just grown to be the best of friends.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm only 18, and its weird cause one of them is 42 and the other is 30.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm so excited cause I miss them a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 I think its pretty cool that my coaches would drive 6 hours to come and visit.
TrainSen	00001	 when I went down a couple of weeks ago back home, they took me out to South padre island and we all got wasted.
TrainSen	00001	 I like it cause I can trust them and more importantly they can trust me.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a little head ache right now.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if it was the peanut butter.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope not.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm really thirsty.
TrainSen	00001	 all I've been drinking is water cause of that diet.
TrainSen	00001	 I just started it yesterday and I probably won't see any results till maybe in a few more days.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss isaiah.
TrainSen	00001	 I love him so much, but he's about 6 hours away and a senior in high school.
TrainSen	00001	 I love him but the last time I went down I didn't feel the same love for him like I used to.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe I'm just in love  with the image of him.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess that can happen.
TrainSen	00001	 I've been really confused lately about a lot of things especially what kind of person I am.
TrainSen	00001	 I wanted to come to UT because it was so liberal and they actually encouraged you to be different here and no one even judges you.
TrainSen	00001	 well, I still don't know who I am.
TrainSen	00001	 I know that I'm sweet, kind, and talented, but there's also the me who lies to people to benefit me and bend the truth so that I don't get into trouble.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe everyone does that.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I'll never know.
TrainSen	00001	 I 'm really glad that I have a good roommate.
TrainSen	00001	 we are exactly alike and we get along really well.
TrainSen	00001	 I just miss everyone from back home , but I know when pam and kristy come to visit me I'll feel a lot better cause we are all going to see sheryl crow and I m so in love with her music.
TrainSen	00001	 I recently went to  a sarah mclachlan concert on july 23 this summer.
TrainSen	00001	 now that was probably the best experience of my life.
TrainSen	00001	 it was awesome.
TrainSen	00001	 their friend niguel is also coming in from nacadoches, I think that's how you spell it.
TrainSen	00001	 I 'm really excited to meet her cause she's hilarious.
TrainSen	00001	 I spoke to her on the phone the other night for about an hour and she is hilarious and I haven't met her in person yet, but I'm looking foward to it cause she  said she likes having a good time and I'm pretty sure we are all going to have a great time together.
TrainSen	00001	 I CAN'T WAIt!!!!1.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm tired now.
TrainSen	01000	     I'm already starting to feel stressed out, and I haven't had any tests yet.
TrainSen	01000	 It's only been two weeks of school so far, and I feel like I have so much to do.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess it's typical for for an incoming freshman, since it's new and all.
TrainSen	01000	 I've never felt so busy in my life.
TrainSen	01000	 Watching TV, my old passion, seems like such a waste of time to me now.
TrainSen	01000	 If I have spare time, I could actually be checking out Austin, like the duck boat, which our RA told us about.
TrainSen	01000	 It seems so cool!! A tour bus turning into a boat ?? It's craziness, and a little scary.
TrainSen	01000	 We supposedly may go as a hall, which I highly doubt because we don't seem to have hall unity or whatever.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I had a misconception of how dorm life would be.
TrainSen	01000	 At this point, I think getting an apartment would have been just fine, other than the fact that I'm way closer to my classes living on campus.
TrainSen	01000	 Ok so maybe dorms aren't so bad because I don't think I want to wake up like an hour earlier for the whole public transportation fiasco.
TrainSen	01000	 I really need to figure out the bus routes because I don't know where any of the buses going other than forty acres and far west, which I accidentally got on to during orientation.
TrainSen	01000	 It was a great detour.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow, 20 minutes is a long time, I just realized that.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I was comparing it to how long it takes me to do everything else, it seemed like nothing.
TrainSen	01000	 So yea, back to the stressed out business.
TrainSen	01000	 I've had something to do since the beginning of summer, since I took summer 1 at a community college, then I went to Clinton, Oklahoma to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister-in-law out with the hotel they own there.
TrainSen	01000	 I worked and got paid.
TrainSen	01000	 Good stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 A few days after I got home from Clinton, I made my way to Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 My new home in the Kinsolving dormitory with all the other chics.
TrainSen	01000	 And I think we all know how busy things are around here.
TrainSen	01000	 I thought Christmas break would be relaxing and chill time, but I was mistaken.
TrainSen	01000	 For I found out my closest cousin is getting married January 15, the weekend before classes start.
TrainSen	01000	 This means that for Christmas break, I will be helping out with the wedding, which from experience already I know is very stressful.
TrainSen	01000	 And my cousin has asked me to do a dance at her wedding, which is an Indian tradition for a younger girl in the family to entertain the guests with a vivid dance.
TrainSen	01000	 So now I have to pick a song and choregraph a dance and learn it to perfection so I can perform it in front of hundreds of people.
TrainSen	01000	 Did I mention that I am a nervous person who freaks out easily ?  Oh and by the way, the wedding is in New Mexico, and the reception is in Houston a weekend later, so I have to go back home after a week of being in Austin, followed by who knows how long of being in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
TrainSen	01000	 My home is in Lufkin, a little town of pop.
TrainSen	01000	 35,000 in East Texas, just two hours north of Houston, 3 hours south of Dallas, and four hours east of Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 Man oh man, this is going to be a hectic year.
TrainSen	01000	 And to think I thought studying for my classes was my biggest worry.
TrainSen	01000	 Well maybe I will grow from all these things, in stead of losing my mind.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess we'll see.
TrainSen	01000	 Hey, that kind of relates to Psychology huh ?  Maybe I can be a case study, which I read about in the textbook.
TrainSen	00010	     When I think about what I'm thinking, a void pops up.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess because the brain never really stops, it's hard to pinpoint an exact thought in any moment.
TrainSen	00010	 I can recall past topics that have rambled through my mind however, so that's what I'll dicuss.
TrainSen	00010	 A topic that's popluar in my brain is my boyfriend (surprising right?)  I think about how happy I am in our relationship and how much of a good friend and boyfriend he is.
TrainSen	00010	 He goes to college at Trinity University, which is in my hometown of San Antonio.
TrainSen	00010	 We see eachother nearly every weekend, so it's not hard to sustain the relationship.
TrainSen	00010	 Though, I constantly wonder if he really does care about me.
TrainSen	00010	 He tells me that he does, and I know that he does, but I'm really insecure about that issue.
TrainSen	00010	 My insecurity on that issue stems from my past relationship where my then boyfriend would tell me that he cared about me, but ended the relationship somewhat abruptly without any sign or signal.
TrainSen	00010	 That's probably why I worry so much about it.
TrainSen	00010	 However, I am really happy in my relationship.
TrainSen	00010	 I have no complaints except for my own lack of security.
TrainSen	00010	 On another topic, I have my first test this Thursday.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm a little scared, but I think that I'll be fine.
TrainSen	00010	 I pretty much know the material, but I still need to go over and over it to get it down.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't think I'll have a problem with it.
TrainSen	00010	 At least I hope that I do well.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel exahsted thinking about all the studying I have to do for my upcoming tests.
TrainSen	00010	 I have a chemistry test next week.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know how to do converstions without a table telling me what every measurement is.
TrainSen	00010	 But I guess that I'm going to need to memorize that sort of stuff so I do well.
TrainSen	00010	 It's so imperitive that I do well in college because I have plans to go to medical school after I graduate.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know what else I would do with my life if I didn't get into medical school.
TrainSen	00010	 I have developed some back up plans if you will in case something should happen.
TrainSen	00010	 I could be a teacher if medical school doesn't work out.
TrainSen	00010	 The pay isn't that great but the job seems pretty alright.
TrainSen	00010	 I would enjoy some sort of FBI/CIA type of work also.
TrainSen	00010	 I need something that's going to make me constantly think.
TrainSen	00010	 Though I hate studying, as every student does, keeping my mind on the go is something I love.
TrainSen	00010	 I think that's why I played soccer all my life.
TrainSen	00010	 Soccer is a game of constant thinking.
TrainSen	00010	 There is no stopping in soccer.
TrainSen	00010	 There are no time outs, so you can't stop to regroup.
TrainSen	00010	 You have to be on your toes and know your stuff to be a good soccer player.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I was still playing soccer.
TrainSen	00010	 I really miss it.
TrainSen	00010	 I stopped playing after my last high school season a few months back.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel sort of empty without it.
TrainSen	00010	 It was such a big part of my life for so long.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I'm going to attempt to walk on next year to the UT soccer team.
TrainSen	00010	 It's really hard to do that though.
TrainSen	00010	 The team is extremely competative.
TrainSen	00010	 Though, I think after I talk to my coaches back home, maybe they can help.
TrainSen	00010	 My main concern at the moment is doing well in school.
TrainSen	00010	 I really need to buckle down and study.
TrainSen	00010	 I study everyday, but I need to do it more I think.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe I'm just stressing about my upcoming tests.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm scared about my chemistry test.
TrainSen	00010	 Though, I think with the right amount memorization of some problems along with some other material, that I'll be fine.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to start preparing for my biology test tomorrow.
TrainSen	00010	 The test is Thursday, so I have 2 days to get in all the information.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel tired right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I had came back to Austin earlier so I would've started on my work earlier.
TrainSen	00010	 Well, tomorrow's another day, so I guess I'll just do a lot of studying tomorrow.
TrainSen	00010	 There's no sense in doing it right this second when I'm not feeling to good and when I'm tired.
TrainSen	00010	 My main priority is studying for my biology test Thursday.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to go over the old exam she gave to us.
TrainSen	00010	 My boyfriend just called me, but I had to tell him that I would call him back so I could finish this writing assignment.
TrainSen	00010	 I really hope I do well on my test Thursday.
TrainSen	00010	 If I did well, I would be so happy.
TrainSen	00010	 That would mean that I actually liked my major and that I could retain the information pertaining to it.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to call my boyfriend back after this, but my roommate ""can't consontrait"" with my talking, so I guess I'll go outside.
TrainSen	00010	 Though, she's talked many a times with her boyfriend while I was reading.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh well, maybe I'm a little more respectful.
TrainSen	01000	So, I can now finally begin this writing.
TrainSen	01000	 I am pretty relaxed right now because I have a wonderful boyfriend.
TrainSen	01000	 He is funny, sweet, and weird like I am.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I am writing in a journal.
TrainSen	01000	 Trying to track my thoughts is weird because I feel like I jump from one idea to the next really quickly.
TrainSen	01000	 It is almost as if I am ADD in the mind.
TrainSen	01000	 That sounds weird.
TrainSen	01000	 I keep hearing this ticking from this tiny pink watch that is sitting right next to me.
TrainSen	01000	 It surprises me how loud it ticks for being a wrist watch.
TrainSen	01000	 Now, I can hear the television from the living room.
TrainSen	01000	 It sounds pretty interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 I can hear the air condition vent outside the apartment complex.
TrainSen	01000	 The air just turned off now but the vent is as loud as can be.
TrainSen	01000	 I like the noise of the keyboard when I type.
TrainSen	01000	 Especially when I type fast.
TrainSen	01000	 The clicks make me think that I am really accomplishing something.
TrainSen	01000	 I am going to stop talking about sounds now and try to see what my mind is does.
TrainSen	01000	 Write now I am a little tired.
TrainSen	01000	 My brain seems a little slow right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel a little overwhelmed by the school work load along with my sorority obligations and my job.
TrainSen	01000	 I am happy thinking about my sorority.
TrainSen	01000	 I love the girls! Everyone of them make me feel important ant that I really matter.
TrainSen	01000	 All the girls are so fun to be around too.
TrainSen	01000	 We all love to go out to parties and dance.
TrainSen	01000	 Man, that car outside that just passed through was very loud.
TrainSen	01000	 The music was rap and not very good.
TrainSen	01000	 I do not understand sometimes why people ride around at night with really loud music and their windows down for everyone to hear.
TrainSen	01000	 It seems kind of dumb to me that it is a week day night and there are people out there thinking they are all cool.
TrainSen	01000	 Man this watch ticking is really bothering me.
TrainSen	01000	 It's amazing how many things I hear when I really think about things.
TrainSen	01000	 This means I am not talking which is a really good accomplishment for me.
TrainSen	01000	 I love to be social and visit with everyone.
TrainSen	01000	 I just remembered that I am missing music.
TrainSen	01000	 Normally, when I type or do any homework I like to listen to some music.
TrainSen	01000	 When I do math, I can listen to any kind of music I want.
TrainSen	01000	 But if I have a paper or any readings, I can only listen to classical music.
TrainSen	01000	 Speaking of music, I had my first T.
TrainSen	01000	 A.
TrainSen	01000	 session for my History of Rock class.
TrainSen	01000	 It was really interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 The teacher is pretty cool and nice.
TrainSen	01000	 We get to listen to all kinds of music every class.
TrainSen	01000	 The only thing is it seemed to me like I was learning all about how music works again like as if I was in band all over again.
TrainSen	01000	 Man, I keep looking at the clock and just realized that my twenty minutes is almost up.
TrainSen	01000	 I remember looking at seven minutes thinking that this was going to be a long twenty minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 I was wrong.
TrainSen	01000	 I am almost done and it went by so fast.
TrainSen	01000	 My stomach doesn't feel too well.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I ate too much marshmallows.
TrainSen	01000	 Also, my head hurts now.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe I just didn't eat enough today.
TrainSen	10000	stream of consciousness.
TrainSen	10000	 Somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner's ""A Light in August""  we read that nnovel in my senior AP English class and although iit was a touch on the  boring side at the beginning, it proved to be quite an interesting story.
TrainSen	10000	 Well I'm in my  dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator  that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times.
TrainSen	10000	 I.
TrainSen	10000	 E: when I'm trying to take a  nap.
TrainSen	10000	 Our refrigerator is in the closet.
TrainSen	10000	 It was in the middle of the room, but my roommate  moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead.
TrainSen	10000	 My  roommate's name is Ricky and he's been out of town this weekend as far as I can tell.
TrainSen	10000	 He  kind of just didn't come home on friday night so my assumption is that he's visiting his  family.
TrainSen	10000	 I think he's from Laredo, but I could be mistaken.
TrainSen	10000	 Ricky is dating a girl named  Natalie and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne.
TrainSen	10000	 Because it smells like crap!  Which sucks, because it's a really expensive Dolce and Gabbana or however you spell it.
TrainSen	10000	 It  really is terrible because it's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to  everything in our room.
TrainSen	10000	 Especially all my clothes, which has made me start to smell like  him.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh I hate it.
TrainSen	10000	 I always want to say something, but it would be weird saying to him that  his designer cologne smells like ass and that I could make the scent personally with some  onions and curry.
TrainSen	10000	 God! I've been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of  weeks, but haven't exactly found one.
TrainSen	10000	 Well I found one on guadalupe, but haven't looked at  what the times are for mass or whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 My dad is really pushing me to start going to  church because in the last few years he's become somewhat of a Jesus freak.
TrainSen	10000	 He's not bad,  but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things.
TrainSen	10000	 For  instance, I joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it; refuses to help pay for it  simply because he doesn't like fraternities.
TrainSen	10000	 But he doesn't exactly say why.
TrainSen	10000	 And since he's  never been in one I don't see how he can make such a judgement.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well, my dad and I  went camping this weekend.
TrainSen	10000	 We like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a  place called Reimer's Ranch.
TrainSen	10000	 So we found a new camp site called Krause Springs and it  was really nice.
TrainSen	10000	 So we camped there with a fire and the whole 9 yards or whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 But  me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that I took  the plastic rain cover off the tent and went and laid near where the fire was on the  ground.
TrainSen	10000	 It was pretty bad, but I made it through.
TrainSen	10000	 Only got about 3 and a half hours of  sleep though.
TrainSen	10000	 ughh.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well, when we all woke up we went and got breakfast and headed  to Reimer's and it was closed! so all that work for nothing.
TrainSen	10000	 But we didn't give up hope and  went to this other place they call the greenbelt and got set up to climb there, but only got  to do one route because it started to rain.
TrainSen	10000	 So after that our hopes were pretty much shot  so my dad just brought me back to my dorm this morning around noon and I took a nap  that I just woke up from about 20 minutes ago.
TrainSen	10000	 So my weekend was pretty lackluster but  it'll be ok because I know next weekend will be fun enough to make up for this one.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh  well.
TrainSen	10000	 My mom just called me a second ago and I was like, ""can I call you right back? I'm  doing a project"" and she's so understanding and just said ""bye"" really quick so after I'm  done with this thingy I'll call her back.
TrainSen	10000	 I've actually been keeping in touch with my mom  pretty well since I moved here which has been nicer than I imagined it would.
TrainSen	10000	 I expected it  to be annoying talking to her too much but I was mistaken.
TrainSen	10000	 I've also been talking to my  sister via email which has been fun.
TrainSen	10000	 She's so funny and always has something to say, but  whenever I call home and she answers it's like we have nothing to say and I just ask for  mom.
TrainSen	10000	 kind of funny, but it's cool.
TrainSen	10000	 I know it's weird, but the thing I miss the most about  home is my dog.
TrainSen	10000	 I have a full-blooded springer spaniel named Lola and she's such an  awesome dog.
TrainSen	10000	 I miss her so much, but I'm hoping that if I live in a frat house next year I  can bring her along so we don't have to be apart anymore.
TrainSen	00100	Ok well I'm thinking about how long of a day it was, I got to school kind of late and I was almost late to my first class.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not really smelling anything right now because my nose is a little stuffy and runny I think it is due to my girlfriend who has been getting sick lately, we went to buy tylenol cold at the target on 35.
TrainSen	00100	 I just spoke to here and she said that she was going to take a little nap and I told her not to because she was complaining all day that she had so much to do and there wasn't any time to do it.
TrainSen	00100	 Well she didn't listen to me she said for me to call her at 7:15 if she hasnt called me.
TrainSen	00100	 she went with me to psy class today even though she already took it last semester.
TrainSen	00100	 she was very moved by the way the professor was.
TrainSen	00100	 I think she said I wish I had him for my psy class.
TrainSen	00100	 I told before that he was very cool like our communications teacher dr.
TrainSen	00100	 daly who is a very cool teacher as well, his class is awesome he's so charismatic, today we had a supplemental discussion for that class and I have my girlfriends friend from back home in that class who just broke up with her boyfriend whom she had been going out with for about two years or so, and we were just talking and she was telling me how she hated our comm.
TrainSen	00100	 class because all they talk about in that class is relationships and she feels sad every time he uses one of the students as examples, now on the topic of my girlfriends friends.
TrainSen	00100	 By the way her name is desiree and she is beautiful and I love her a lot, I don't know when and where but someday we plan on getting married, I think we are different than most couples, I know that everybody probably says that but I really do think that we are because yes we spend a lot of time together and I hear that that is a bad thing but were different because we involve God in our relationship, not as much as we should but more than most couples I think, in the summer we read the bible every night for the last couple of weeks.
TrainSen	00100	 But since we got up here, we haven't read it at all, I think its because were so happy with each other and we love to spend time with one another that its hard to do something else besides kissing and having sex at night.
TrainSen	00100	 now back to her other friend named nancy.
TrainSen	00100	 Well she is rooming with desiree's old roommate kelly, and well a few days ago kelly had a talk with nancy, she was really mad from what I hear because she took the time to underline in the contract that no one else has permission to stay for more than three consecutive nights in their apt.
TrainSen	00100	 without some kind of notice, and well nancy has a boyfriend who is always over there and kelly gets really mad.
TrainSen	00100	 Me and desiree were thinking that she is just jealous because her boyfriend isn't over there as much as he should be.
TrainSen	00100	 like my roommate said that he wasn't going to talk to his ex when he came up here because she broke up with him last year when she was still in high school and he was up here.
TrainSen	00100	 well now that she is up here too, he said that he was not going to talk to her at all, well shit that didn't last very long, just the other night he stayed at her dorm because they had to homework for the same class that they both share.
TrainSen	00100	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00100	 What a coincidence, I mean me and my girlfriend had a class last together too and I think that that helped out a lot because no matter if we didn't see each other every day we definetly saw each other on those days that we had class, I mean we really werent together yet but that certainly helped out our relationship a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 my friend oj keeps calling me because he wants to go eat at the olive garden and I told him that I don't know because I running tight on money and I kind of got in trouble the other day with my mom because I went on a little shopping spree and spent a good amount of money at diesel.
TrainSen	00100	 the part that she got mad at was the jeans that I bought for 100 dollars and that's because they were on sale.
TrainSen	00100	 she said imagine how many shirts u could have bought with that.
TrainSen	00010	     So I think this is a very cool assignment for the students to complete.
TrainSen	00010	 It gives a very good look at what we are thinking in our heads.
TrainSen	00010	 I probably don't realize some of the things that I think.
TrainSen	00010	 maybe after looking at this I will be suprised or shocked or some other feeling.
TrainSen	00010	 I smell food.
TrainSen	00010	 I just ate but food smells so good that it makes me want more.
TrainSen	00010	 I have this weezer song in my head.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't like weezer yet this song gets stuck in my head.
TrainSen	00010	 I hope it gets out fast because it is annoying.
TrainSen	00010	 my neck feels like it is rubber and just wants to fall down, taking my head with it.
TrainSen	00010	 that would hurt.
TrainSen	00010	 never have I done so much reading as I have done this past week.
TrainSen	00010	 it is annoying.
TrainSen	00010	 I do not enjoy reading much.
TrainSen	00010	 oh well.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess I have to do it anyway.
TrainSen	00010	 my window doesn't get enough light through because it faces our balcony which blocks off some of the light.
TrainSen	00010	 the apartment is nice.
TrainSen	00010	 I get my own room and it is very spacious.
TrainSen	00010	 I hear a ticking sound and it is not a clock.
TrainSen	00010	 its bugging me and I think its a result of me typing.
TrainSen	00010	 yep.
TrainSen	00010	 I stopped and the ticking stopped.
TrainSen	00010	 I think it is a clock but the clock is rubbing against the wall and isn't on.
TrainSen	00010	 how ironic maybe.
TrainSen	00010	 interesting.
TrainSen	00010	 it stopped.
TrainSen	00010	 they weezer song was out of my head but it came back for an encore.
TrainSen	00010	 ill be right back sorry.
TrainSen	00010	 blanked out for a second.
TrainSen	00010	 the days seem to go by very fast.
TrainSen	00010	 the weekends go slow however.
TrainSen	00010	 I like the weekends.
TrainSen	00010	 this weekend should be great because I will go hoome for the labor day holiday.
TrainSen	00010	 seeing my friends from back home alwasy makes me happy.
TrainSen	00010	 greek mythology has too many  names to remember even a quarter of them.
TrainSen	00010	 its very a nnoying.
TrainSen	00010	 how many times have  I said annoying in my train of thought.
TrainSen	00010	 a good nap would be nice right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I like that painting of the melting clocks.
TrainSen	00010	 its very surreal and somehow that makes me feel good.
TrainSen	00010	 I wanted a poster of it but they were like ten dollars.
TrainSen	00010	 its just not worth it to me.
TrainSen	00010	 I am a very economical person when handling money.
TrainSen	00010	 sometimes its good and bad.
TrainSen	00010	 a ten dollar poster wasn't a wise choice for me though.
TrainSen	00010	 cooking.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to start cooking more things.
TrainSen	00010	 sure the microwave is awesome but I need to expand my cuisine.
TrainSen	00010	 iron chef.
TrainSen	00010	 funny show.
TrainSen	00010	 iron chef should fight emeril.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder who would win.
TrainSen	00010	 they should put those old batman captions like bam, and wham, and pow on Emerils show when he says those things.
TrainSen	00010	 it will give it an old school flavor.
TrainSen	00010	 flavor is good.
TrainSen	00010	 does water have a flavor.
TrainSen	00010	 is the flavor water.
TrainSen	00010	 who cares its good when you're thirsty.
TrainSen	00010	 I just wish it had like b vitamins like powerade.
TrainSen	00010	 because water doesn't have like those sugars and stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 or are the b vitamins coming from the sugars.
TrainSen	00010	 ill look into it.
TrainSen	00010	 my mouth is dry.
TrainSen	00010	 I oculd actually go for some water right now.
TrainSen	00010	 my neck keeps getting my head closer and closer to the table.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I could fly.
TrainSen	00010	 I just saw some birds flying.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I could do that.
TrainSen	00010	 where would I go.
TrainSen	00010	 I'd probably go to some tropical climate if my body allowed me too.
TrainSen	00010	 that would be awesome.
TrainSen	00010	 today is the first day of the rest of my life.
TrainSen	00010	 that quote always struck me as very cool sounding.
TrainSen	00010	 is hould really start using my planner to right down what I need to get done.
TrainSen	00010	 my memory doesn't serve me quite well.
TrainSen	00010	 I want some of the energy arizona iced tea.
TrainSen	00010	 I haven't had any for  quite some time.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm due for some.
TrainSen	00010	 but I guess right now all I got is water.
TrainSen	00010	 that will have to do.
TrainSen	00010	 potpourri is such a weird word.
TrainSen	00010	 but smells nice so I guess they are even.
TrainSen	00010	 I bet it is fun to read other peoples streams of thought.
TrainSen	00010	 it must be amusing to see all the weird things people come up with without maybe realizing it much.
TrainSen	00010	 this is one of the best writing assignments I've ever had to write because there is no structure.
TrainSen	00010	 I am a poor writer.
TrainSen	00010	 I should practice and get help.
TrainSen	00010	 I probabloy won't though.
TrainSen	00010	 ill just get by onw what I can do.
TrainSen	00010	 it just isn't my thing.
TrainSen	00010	 donde esta el biblioteca.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to work on myh Spanish to.
TrainSen	00010	 hopefully I won't have to take a Spanish class.
TrainSen	00010	 that would piss me off.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't stand learning that language or any language for that matter.
TrainSen	00010	 it would take me too much time.
TrainSen	00010	 I think tex mex will serve me just fine.
TrainSen	00010	 bien bien bien.
TrainSen	00010	 if my phone rings right now its going to scare the hell otta me because I'm so itno righting this.
TrainSen	00100	     Hello.
TrainSen	00100	 Good morning! I actually woke up early this morning, which really surprised me because we had a crazy night last night.
TrainSen	00100	 Okay, I am listening to the most awesome song right now.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm wondering if I should listen to it again.
TrainSen	00100	 Like start it over when it's over.
TrainSen	00100	 Or, on second thought, should I just start it over right now? Ah, who cares? Anyway I'm wondering when I should go to the cafeteria to get brunch.
TrainSen	00100	 I had the most strange experience this morning when I got up.
TrainSen	00100	 I walked to the kitchen to get a water from the frige and there was my suite  mate with a guy asleep on the bed in the living room.
TrainSen	00100	 Yes, we actually have a bed in the living room.
TrainSen	00100	 I had a really sucky room mate and we weren't exactly getting along so she moved out and we used her bed as another couch.
TrainSen	00100	 I am going to be so tired when these 20 minutes are over.
TrainSen	00100	 Haha, my fingers are already getting tired of typing.
TrainSen	00100	 Hold on, I'm going to start over my song.
TrainSen	00100	 Okay, sorry.
TrainSen	00100	 I honestly don't know exactly what it is that I am supposed to be doing in this assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't believe I ever have actually had an assignment to just type on what goes through my head.
TrainSen	00100	 I always have a lot of crap going through my head.
TrainSen	00100	 I am ADD positive.
TrainSen	00100	 pretty bad actually.
TrainSen	00100	 And it affects what I think about every day.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if it will every go away.
TrainSen	00100	 Is that even possible? I wonder if my professor even knows who I am.
TrainSen	00100	 Doubt it.
TrainSen	00100	 Man that sucks.
TrainSen	00100	 I always stress about whether my teachers know who I am because I think that is awesome if you are on a first name basis.
TrainSen	00100	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00100	 What should I do to make him know me? Perhaps I should make a big scene in class.
TrainSen	00100	 But I don't want all of my class mates to think I'm like a major loser.
TrainSen	00100	 Okay now I am beginning to wonder if I should just like leave this thing going while I go get something to eat.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know if that would be allowed, but it is quite tempting.
TrainSen	00100	 Man, you know what sucks? On Friday, I woke up like really freakin' sick and I missed my math class along with my chemistry class, and I missed my quiz in chemistry.
TrainSen	00100	 Ugh! I wonder what my teacher is going to have to say about that because she like requires doctor's notes and crap for her class.
TrainSen	00100	 Can we say IMMATURE? Oooooo, I love this song too! Twista: Celebrity Overnight.
TrainSen	00100	 Aw! It reminds me of my ex-boyfriend.
TrainSen	00100	 That sucks because he hasn't been too nice to me here lately.
TrainSen	00100	 Man I could talk all day about him.
TrainSen	00100	 Doubt the reader of this crappy paper would really enjoy that, but that is now what I am thinking about so I guess get ready.
TrainSen	00100	 He is so cute.
TrainSen	00100	 He is so sweet.
TrainSen	00100	 Besides lately.
TrainSen	00100	 He always could cheer me up, but we broke up right before I left because he is just now a senior in high school and he didn't want to date when I was living 4 hours away.
TrainSen	00100	 I must say that is a long distance away from the person that you are dating, but I really do believe I love him.
TrainSen	00100	 He is so the person for me, and I don't know exactly how to take that.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know if I should try to get over him or if I should just keep talking to him and trying to get him to come visit me.
TrainSen	00100	 Or if I should even tell him that I love him.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so confused! Urgh! I wish this program could talk back because I would be so happy to receive advice.
TrainSen	00100	 I thought it was so funny when my psychology teacher.
TrainSen	00100	 Hold on I totally forgot what I was thinking about.
TrainSen	00100	 Anyway someone puked in my living room the other night.
TrainSen	00100	 Yea, it really pissed me off.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder why they didn't just go to the freakin' bathroom! It's like.
TrainSen	00100	 Hey I'm drunk.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh yea I'm just going to sit here and puke all over my friend's floor and make them clean it up.
TrainSen	00100	 Damnit, grow up! I want to take a nap so bad.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what is more important, napping or eating.
TrainSen	00100	 Perhaps I'll get something to eat and then go take a nap.
TrainSen	00100	 It feels good to get an assignment done.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to work on chemistry later and I'm honestly thinking I'm going to get some beer to drink before I start on it.
TrainSen	00100	 Man, why do college people drink so much? I've never gone like a whole week drinking every single night.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like I'm going to like die of some liver disease.
TrainSen	00100	 Haha, that would suck.
TrainSen	00100	 Okay, I don't like thinking about that.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope I make a good grade in this class.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm kind of trying to rely on this class to help my GPA.
TrainSen	00100	 If I can pull off a 3.
TrainSen	00100	 0 then I would totally kick ass.
TrainSen	00100	 My parents are thinking I'm going to do badly.
TrainSen	00100	 Hah, I'll show them.
TrainSen	00100	 Drinking every night and going to class and making good grades.
TrainSen	00100	 Damn I'm going to blow them away.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh yea did I mention we don't have a freakin' TV in our room anymore? Yea, it sucks gathering around a freakin' laptop to watch a movie.
TrainSen	00100	 Yes! I only have like 3 more minutes to type.
TrainSen	00100	 Okay, now less! I wonder how long my suite mate is going to sleep today.
TrainSen	00100	 My other suite mate apparently didn't even make it home last night.
TrainSen	00100	 I went to bed with straight hair and woke up with really curly hair.
TrainSen	00100	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00100	 Wonder what happened there.
TrainSen	00100	 I remember waltsing last night.
TrainSen	00100	 The Australians taught me how to walts and how to do the salsa.
TrainSen	00100	 It was awesome.
TrainSen	00100	 until I burned my finger.
TrainSen	00100	 I suppose that's another story.
TrainSen	00100	 Okay, I hear someone talking.
TrainSen	00100	 Yes! My time is almost up.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess it just like cuts my sentence off when time is up.
TrainSen	00100	 That sucks.
TrainSen	00100	 I hate leaving things unfinished.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm going to stop now because I hate I when I get cut off and I only have a few seconds.
TrainSen	00100	 Looking foreward to class!!.
TrainSen	00100	 .
TrainSen	00100	 .
TrainSen	00100	 Not really.
TrainSen	00100	 Sorry.
TrainSen	00001	     I am at a study hall room at the time wondering what I will think about that I am going to write.
TrainSen	00001	 There are people behind me talking and one went Ole Miss which makes me think of a friend of mine from high school who is a freshman there now.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder how he is doing now along with all my other friends that is not attending UT.
TrainSen	00001	 There are actually several people going here from my high school but I only see about half of them on a regular basis.
TrainSen	00001	 I am a little stressed with all the things going on because I have done the thing that everyone has said not to but I think no matter what it happens to everyone.
TrainSen	00001	 It is just the thought of all the freedom and then all of a sudden a couple weeks go by and there are quizes, tests, and papers due at the same time.
TrainSen	00001	 I am also stressed about so many different things such as a typical college freshman is.
TrainSen	00001	 One guy said that his fine arts was theater and dance.
TrainSen	00001	 That made me think about when I was confused on what to take when I was signing up for classes.
TrainSen	00001	 People ask me what this is that I am typing because they can read exactly what I am thinking.
TrainSen	00001	 I am actually hungary with all these people talking about food.
TrainSen	00001	 Is kind of a word? Not sure but it should be.
TrainSen	00001	 I just found a phone on the desk but completely forgot that it was mine until I opened it up.
TrainSen	00001	 I lost my phone a week ago so I don't have any of the numbers that I used to have, I hope this is not being graded for correct grammer because I am trying to type as fast as I think.
TrainSen	00001	 I have already been typing for 10 minutes already and am wondering what else I am going to talk about.
TrainSen	00001	 I also don't know what class I am going to drop, which haves to be done tomorrow.
TrainSen	00001	 I cannot take 16 hours that I am currently signed up for so I will drop one to drop down to 13 hours.
TrainSen	00001	 A friend of mine just called saying that he cannot make it to lunch.
TrainSen	00001	 A guy is just now sitting beside me and he is about to start eating something.
TrainSen	00001	 That makes me hungary again.
TrainSen	00001	 He is reading everything I type and just corrected me on a mistake.
TrainSen	00001	 I am running out of things to say or talk about.
TrainSen	00001	 I am thinking now about my place and hearing some stories in the background.
TrainSen	00001	 Most people are done with their homework and are asking me questions about this assignment, I am actually kind of comfortable right now at the computer.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't have a computer yet at my apartment so it is really hard for me to get to an actual one to do assignments and get notes off the internet.
TrainSen	00001	 I have yet to figure out how many notes to take from class since everything is different in college.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a lot of stuff to do like go to WalMart, the grocery store and other places to get caught up on everything.
TrainSen	00001	 Only a few more minutes left until I am done with this.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder again if this is for completion grade or even if it is going to be read.
TrainSen	00001	 I bet the counselors read all these to see if we are all okay since majority of the class is freshman.
TrainSen	00001	 Wow, I cannot believe that the twenty minutes is almost up.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm going into a blank thought because of this pressure that the timer is putting on me for some reason.
TrainSen	10000	     I am finally taking a break from doing my math homework.
TrainSen	10000	 I am so excited to finally be doing nothing.
TrainSen	10000	 I am so excited that I finally got my laundry back because now I do not have to worry about it, but I do need to do a load of some personal items.
TrainSen	10000	 While looking around my room I see my side pretty neat and then I look at my roommate's side and it is a pig-sty.
TrainSen	10000	 It bothers me because she has buckets overflowing everywhere, when they could easily at least be hidden under her bed.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe we will have a talk about that later?  Who knows.
TrainSen	10000	 But I cannot wait for this weekend because not only is it a three day weekend, but that's one more day that I don't have to go to class.
TrainSen	10000	 I love living here at Towers but the walls are paper thin.
TrainSen	10000	 I can hear anything and everything that my roommate/suitmate say and sometimes that's okay but when I'm trying to concentrate on something it kind of bothers me.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well, life could be worse.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder what else I have to do to prepare myself for tomorrow?  I think I need to go to Allie's room at some point to get her notes from Philosophy that I missed last week, and I really need to go return a book to the Co-Op and go by the bank because the stupid people sent me my check card with my dad's name on it.
TrainSen	10000	 Why would they do such a thing?  Oh well at least it won't be too hard to fix.
TrainSen	10000	 At least I hope it won't be too hard to fix.
TrainSen	10000	 I am so tired but I got so much sleep last night and I don't understand how I'm so tired after only going to class for an hour and a half today? It makes no sense to me.
TrainSen	10000	 Maybe I am still transforming into the ""college-life-style"" and I'm just not used to it yet?  I'm getting very sleepy but there's no point in trying to take a nap because I know it won't happen for me.
TrainSen	10000	 I love how I have so many pictures around my room because everywhere I look I am reminded of a fun time with my friends from home.
TrainSen	10000	 Speaking of home, I feel like so many people are going home this weekend.
TrainSen	10000	 As much as I would like to go home, I don't think I'm quite ready to leave here yet.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't think I'm settled in enough yet to get up and leave already.
TrainSen	10000	 Even if I did go home my parents wouldn't be there because they are going to the lake.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if I will see them at all since they'll be so close to me now?  Maybe I will call them later and ask.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh and I need to call Mimi back since she left me a message yesterday.
TrainSen	10000	 I'll call her later when I have a few minutes to spare since I know the conversation will last for a lifetime.
TrainSen	10000	 Or I guess I should say it will last for a long time.
TrainSen	10000	 It's amazing how I was here in my room for so long by myself without my roommate or suitmate, and then all of a sudden it's like they both appeared at the same time, and within five minutes they both left and I'm left alone again in quietness.
TrainSen	10000	 I will most definitely take advantage of that alone/quiet time, but then again sometimes I do get bored sitting here by myself.
TrainSen	10000	 They asked me if I wanted to go eat with them but I just ate a few hours ago, I might as well save my meals for when I'm actually hungry right?  Wow, looking up at the clock I never realized how long twenty minutes really is.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel almost out of breath because I've been typing so much so fast and its only been a mere ten minutes.
TrainSen	10000	 My  sister just called but I have to call her back.
TrainSen	10000	 She didn't seem to mind because she said that her and her friend Jessi would be searching for Jessi's car anyway.
TrainSen	10000	 So I wonder what happened to it?  Did she park somewhere and forget where she left it?  Weird.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I never do that.
TrainSen	10000	 Although it would probably be hard for me to do that since I've only driven my car twice in two weeks.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if that's bad for it?  Maybe I need to try to drive it at least once a week to make sure it still works?  I should probably ask my dad about that.
TrainSen	10000	 So its only four oclock in the afternoon and I feel like its ten at night.
TrainSen	10000	 Why is that?  Well I just hope I keep up with everything as much as I'm ""supposed"" to because college is definitely not like high school.
TrainSen	10000	 High school is like a joke compared to what I've experienced in only 5 days.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh well at least we get a month of for winter break instead of two weeks.
TrainSen	10000	 So about winter break.
TrainSen	10000	 I cannot wait to go home because I think we will have like a reunion of everyone getting to be together once again.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm sure Ill see most of my friends over Thanksgiving break but the first time we will all be together with the ""old gang"" will probably be Christmas break.
TrainSen	10000	 That will be a fun break, and I know it will be great seeing everyone again.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if my family will be taking any kind of of trip?  Hmmm there's another thing I need to check into because I don't like finding out about things like that at the last minute.
TrainSen	10000	 Especially since my best friend who lives in Virginia will be in Houston for part of the break.
TrainSen	10000	 If I missed her because I was on a family trip I would be extremely upset so I need to figure it out to make sure I will be around.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow my eyes are shutting so much maybe I should go get some coffee from downstairs? Sounds like a great idea and it will probably make my throat feel a little better since it's kind of of sore.
TrainSen	10000	 I think just getting used to college life and my new schedule is wearing me out enough to feel a little under the weather.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't wait to fully recooperate so I can feel 100% again.
TrainSen	10000	 Then hopefully I will be in a better mood and not so irritable?  Hopefully!  Well now getting back to the matter at hand, this assignment.
TrainSen	10000	 ALthough it has been time consuming, it's probably been the easiest assignment of my entire life.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow and that's saying a lot!!!  I am so interested to see what our next assignment is like, since our professor said that there will never be another one like this again.
TrainSen	10000	 Our class is huge and I actually saw a second person that I know yesterday when I was walking out.
TrainSen	10000	 Speaking of I should probably call that friend of mine.
TrainSen	01000	     I can't believe I am doing this.
TrainSen	01000	 This homework is due on Friday.
TrainSen	01000	 However, I am working on it instead of studying for some other assignments given by other professors.
TrainSen	01000	 I am so behind right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I didn't even read a page of psy yet.
TrainSen	01000	 Why? It is all because my sis's bf lost his carkey!!! I left the book in his car on Friday.
TrainSen	01000	 And the result of this? I have to wait till Monday 1AM.
TrainSen	01000	 That's when he got his spare key from HOUSTON! My room is so not-neat right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I need more time! I went to my sister's friend's apartment just now.
TrainSen	01000	 His place is so messy.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess the place that I live in is not bad at all.
TrainSen	01000	 The psy class is so huge.
TrainSen	01000	 I am in TIP classes.
TrainSen	01000	 Most of the classes are not in the big auditorium.
TrainSen	01000	 I am excited about being a college students.
TrainSen	01000	 I met a lot of new people.
TrainSen	01000	 People from different cities.
TrainSen	01000	 There is a badminton club in UT Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 I am joining it for sure.
TrainSen	01000	 I love playing badminton.
TrainSen	01000	 However, in my high school, we only played badminton during PE for a week or so.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder why people here don't like badminton that much.
TrainSen	01000	 Bio is so interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 I like chemistry too.
TrainSen	01000	 However, there are some serious reading that need to be done at home.
TrainSen	01000	 On top of all those, there are in-class quizzes and discussion that I have to attend.
TrainSen	01000	 Where can I find all the time to do all the thing that need to be done? I am spending 20 minutes right now to complete an assignment that is not going to be due in a few days.
TrainSen	01000	 Why am I doing this right now, at midnight? Am I crazy? I do need to get some sleep.
TrainSen	01000	 However, if I get some sleep right now, I can never get my stuff done.
TrainSen	01000	 I am going to take a hip-hop/funk dance class.
TrainSen	01000	 I got my flight ticket back to Malaysia.
TrainSen	01000	 I am so worried that I might have to cancel that flight when my bio professor said that the final is going to be on the 18th.
TrainSen	01000	 I thought I might not be able to make it again.
TrainSen	01000	 I had fun during critical thinking class.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean, what is the purpose of taking critical thinking class? I do not get it.
TrainSen	01000	 However, the class is pretty relaxing--so far.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder what the exam is going to be like.
TrainSen	01000	 What about chemistry? How is the exam going to be like? I met some of my siser's friends.
TrainSen	01000	 I met some new friends as well.
TrainSen	01000	 I am still seeing some of my old friends.
TrainSen	01000	 However, we don't see each other that often since we all have different classes on different time and date.
TrainSen	01000	 On top of that, I have some friends that don't go to UT Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go to San Marcos.
TrainSen	01000	 I want a handbag.
TrainSen	01000	 I bought myself a wallet.
TrainSen	01000	 I went to Urban Outfitters.
TrainSen	01000	 I will go broke if I keep on shopping.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't shop that much.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't really like going to mall.
TrainSen	01000	 My sister loves going to mall.
TrainSen	01000	 I think going to mall just to LOOK for stuff to buy is a waste of time.
TrainSen	01000	 I would not do that unless I am extremely bored.
TrainSen	01000	 Sometimes I like to buy artistic stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 Am I artistic? I don't think so.
TrainSen	01000	 I doubt it.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't see myself as a creative person.
TrainSen	01000	 I love sciences and maths.
TrainSen	01000	 Those are my favorite subjects.
TrainSen	01000	 I totally dislike government, history, geography, etc.
TrainSen	01000	 I think psychology is interesting---so far it seems to be.
TrainSen	01000	 I am all worn out.
TrainSen	01000	 I had been up since 8:30 in the morning until right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I had a really busy schedule.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go to my friend's apartment and start karaoke-ing.
TrainSen	01000	 Is this the right spelling? No one will know anyway.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go back to Houston and see what's going on over there.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to see my friends in Houston/Sugar Land once again.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go to Malaysia and start shopping.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go to Hong Kong and eat those delicious food.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to get my homework done.
TrainSen	01000	 So much to do, so little time.
TrainSen	01000	 People who live right next to my apartment are kind of noisy.
TrainSen	01000	 They party like almost every night.
TrainSen	01000	 I totally understand that since this is Austin and all of them are UT students.
TrainSen	01000	 I am just telling the truth here.
TrainSen	01000	 No offense to anyone.
TrainSen	01000	 Who will disagree on that? I want to sleep now.
TrainSen	01000	 But I still need to write more and then do more reading.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't want to be a know-nothing person when I go to bio lecture tomorrow.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe I write that much in this short amount of time.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate writing.
TrainSen	01000	 Writing is not my strong part at all.
TrainSen	01000	 I like to eat.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to eat sushi right now.
TrainSen	01000	 Korean food will do too.
TrainSen	00001	    The first thing that coems to mind is how much I hate the stupid popups that are getting in the way of my writing and slowing down my laptop.
TrainSen	00001	 The man that invented those should be shot.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I'm starting to remember what was said in class about this assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 It seemed like a really dumb assignment to do, but I prefer writing for only twenty minutes versus actually drafting up some essay and spending hours writing and rewriting and losing sleep over it.
TrainSen	00001	 There really isn't much too this, which should've been fairly obvious to everyone in class.
TrainSen	00001	 Why is it that no matter where you go there's always someone really really stupid that'll ask the same question that someone else asked only a few seconds before them.
TrainSen	00001	 If I was a teacher that would really annoy me.
TrainSen	00001	 It would be fun to put those dog shock collars on those types of people, you know the ones that everyone growns inwardly (and sometimes outwardly) at as soon as they open their mouth because nothing good will come out.
TrainSen	00001	 I actually really do like the psych class.
TrainSen	00001	 The assignment is aggravating because I know that odds are no one will ever read this and I'm doing it just for my own amusement.
TrainSen	00001	 I know if I cheat and just copy and paste something or bang on the keyboards for 20 mins, then I'll feel bad about it.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well, 20 minutes isn't that big of a deal anyways.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm killing time until my boyfriend gets done with his project so I can talk to him again.
TrainSen	00001	 My mind is trying to go into thinking about my bf, but I'm not going to let that happen.
TrainSen	00001	 I know that most people have a hard time making a ""long distance"" relationship work when the distance really isn't that far.
TrainSen	00001	 All the girls I've met left a bf in Houston or Dallas.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish that's how far away he was because I could go and see him on the weekends.
TrainSen	00001	 Actually, if he was anywhere in the US, then it would really help, but I knew what I was getting into when we decided to stay together.
TrainSen	00001	 No more boyfriend talk.
TrainSen	00001	 I start looking around the room to think of something else, but the first thing that catches my eye is my roommate's vase of big yellow flowers that her bf just sent her.
TrainSen	00001	 That's really not helping.
TrainSen	00001	 I keep thinking about something in Spanish, but I'm guesssing whoever might read this (I doubt anyone ever will) won't know Spanish so I guess I should write it in english.
TrainSen	00001	 La ausencia para el amor es como el viento para el fuego: extingue lo pequeno  y the fuerza a lo grande.
TrainSen	00001	 That would translate to, Absence for love is like wind for fire: it extinguishes the small and gives strength to the large.
TrainSen	00001	 Sounds much better in Spanish though.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I'm starting to remember that anytime Spanish comes up, everyone asks how I know it and when I tell them I lived in South America they always ask if that's where I'm from.
TrainSen	00001	 That has to be THE single most annoying question.
TrainSen	00001	 I've been asked so many times, too many times.
TrainSen	00001	 And no matter how many times I explain I'm from Dallas, and my parents are 100% American, people still assume that my family must be Mexican.
TrainSen	00001	 It's like asking an oriental person if their family is originally from Africa.
TrainSen	00001	 It's just stupid.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't look hispanic at all.
TrainSen	00001	 Everyone assumes too much.
TrainSen	00001	 When I say I lived in South American, they all assume Mexico.
TrainSen	00001	 And when I say no, then they think I must have lived in a hut in the middle of the jungle.
TrainSen	00001	 But its not only the Americans.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I'm remembering all the dumb questions I got when I moved to Lima.
TrainSen	00001	 When I said I'm from Texas, they all said no you're not, you're not wearing any boots and a gallon hat.
TrainSen	00001	 Or they'd ask where my horse was, or what happend if my horse got sick and how would I get to school if that happened.
TrainSen	00001	 Plus I got all the dumb Bush jokes.
TrainSen	00001	 Fern used to call me Bushwa instead of Gushwa, my last name.
TrainSen	00001	 Pretty creative though.
TrainSen	00100	I'm actually really tired, but I want to finish as much homework as I possibly can.
TrainSen	00100	 It's not terribly late so I thought it would be nice to write something on my thoughts right before I go to bed.
TrainSen	00100	 Today was a good day.
TrainSen	00100	 Not too much stress and I talked to a lot of my friends and family.
TrainSen	00100	 Its always nice when I get to talk to old friends from hs.
TrainSen	00100	 today I met a girl that went to the same elementary as me.
TrainSen	00100	 we didn't know each other, but we had a connection because we were from the same town.
TrainSen	00100	 MOst people have never heard of my town before, so it was pretty cool.
TrainSen	00100	 I also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town, which again is strange.
TrainSen	00100	 I actually met a lot of people, one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm glad to know that I have someone that I can study with or ask a question if I need help anytime I want.
TrainSen	00100	 One good thing about college is that it's really easy to make friends.
TrainSen	00100	 Even if you're a shy person, there's always someone who is willing to talk to you.
TrainSen	00100	 I used to be really shy, but I don't have much of a problem introducing myself to random people, I actually enjoy doing that now.
TrainSen	00100	 I look foward to those that I will meet tomorrow, I just hope I can remember everyone's name when I see them again.
TrainSen	00100	 I've met so many people in such a short period of time that it becomes difficult to match names with faces.
TrainSen	00100	 I enjoy all of my classes, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in my decision on what I plan to major in.
TrainSen	00100	 It seems that I really do enjoy chemistry and biology, but I'm really glad to have a psychology class to take my mind off of things that I have to do.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm really excited about Wednesday.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm going to try out for the rowing team.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope I make the team, but I don't want to get my hopes up, so I'm just going to see how it goes.
TrainSen	00100	 Today I went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and I feel much more comfortable with my decision.
TrainSen	00100	 I was able to row correctly, although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement.
TrainSen	00100	 but I was able to row for 2000 meters non-stop my first try, and I think that's pretty good because I only have to row for 500 meters for the tryouts.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not sure how good my chances are at making the team.
TrainSen	00100	 I haven't been on a sports team since middle school.
TrainSen	00100	 but I have been in band since sixth grade.
TrainSen	00100	 band may not be the best workout ever or the most strenuous, but marching can get pretty tiring, and I think that it has prepared me a little for this.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm really good with endurance which is key in rowing.
TrainSen	00100	 In high school, we had to march for 8 minutes straight.
TrainSen	00100	 my senior year I had a solo and I had to run around to my different sets and then stand still and play a long slow balad for a couple of minutes and make it musical.
TrainSen	00100	 That was pretty hard to play without people realizing I'm completely out of breath.
TrainSen	00100	 But it was really rewarding, I had the opportunity to play in front of thousands at a time at our football games.
TrainSen	00100	 I could never get up in front of a crowd and speak or sing, but I can play my flute in front of anyone.
TrainSen	00100	 I really wish I was able to be in the UT band.
TrainSen	00100	 I had always wanted to be part of the band, but now my major doesn't allow the time.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope that later in my college career, I have the chance to be in the marching band at least once.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it would be so much fun.
TrainSen	00100	 Music has always been a big thing in my life, I love to play it, but I also love to listen to it.
TrainSen	00100	 My favorite kind of music is country.
TrainSen	00100	 I especially love george strait.
TrainSen	00100	 I have most of his cd's.
TrainSen	00100	 I know every word to every song he sings, I only need to hear the first chord of one of his songs and I'll know its him.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm also a big fan of 80's movies.
TrainSen	00100	 one of my favorites is young frankenstein.
TrainSen	00100	 mel brooks makes wonderful movies, I think they're all hilarious.
TrainSen	00100	 real genius is another good one I like.
TrainSen	00100	 most of my favorite movies I'm able to quote from beginning to end.
TrainSen	00100	 one of the classics is the princess bride.
TrainSen	00100	 there are so many great one-liners in that movie.
TrainSen	00100	 my dad and I always say random quotes from movies anytime something happens.
TrainSen	00100	 my dad knows the most trivial things.
TrainSen	00100	 he'll know the answer to the most random question you can think of.
TrainSen	00100	 its pointless, but its pretty cool.
TrainSen	00100	 my dad and I are really close, I wish I could be more like my dad.
TrainSen	00100	 we grew really close when my mom passed away when I was little, he remarried, and now I have a brother and a sister.
TrainSen	00100	 I love my little sister so much, she's the cutest.
TrainSen	00100	 she never uses my real name, she always calls me sister.
TrainSen	00100	 I really miss her.
TrainSen	00100	 but I talk to her often and she's always so excited to hear from me.
TrainSen	00100	 she just got a new rabit, she's had 5 and three of them were sold in the stock show and one of them died.
TrainSen	00100	 but now she has 2.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope the heat doesn't get to these two like the others.
TrainSen	00100	 she's always really worried about them.
TrainSen	00100	 she also has a dog, and I have a dog named princess.
TrainSen	00100	 my dog is a choc.
TrainSen	00100	 lab.
TrainSen	00100	 she's really cute, but she's also really old.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm glad she has a new puppy to play with since I won't be there for her all the time.
TrainSen	00100	 I've had her ever since I was little, I miss her too.
TrainSen	00100	 I brought a lot of pictures and things from home so I wouldn't get homesick.
TrainSen	00100	 my room is very comforting I think.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't think I could stand it if it were blank.
TrainSen	00100	 most of my pictures are of my family and of my best friend kelly.
TrainSen	00100	 she goes to corpus with my brother, so she isn't that far away from me.
TrainSen	00100	 we talk all the time online though, so it feels like she's here.
TrainSen	01000	Let's see.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone.
TrainSen	01000	 This is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back.
TrainSen	01000	 Not that she's not a cool person or anything, I just can concentrate better when I'm alone and when it is quiet.
TrainSen	01000	 But that is almost impossibe here in Jester.
TrainSen	01000	 There are always people roaming the halls making loud noises.
TrainSen	01000	 Like right now!  Oh well, it is something I must get used to.
TrainSen	01000	 Or I can do what I did last night.
TrainSen	01000	 Wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done.
TrainSen	01000	 I stayed there until 1:30 a.
TrainSen	01000	 M.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I can do my work better at night.
TrainSen	01000	 My fingers are freezing!  This room is so cold!  I haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm cold even when I go to bed at night with my blanket.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to constantly keep a sweater on and I cannot wear shorts like I used to back at home.
TrainSen	01000	 Aw, home!  I think I am starting to miss being at home.
TrainSen	01000	 I called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me.
TrainSen	01000	 This, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs.
TrainSen	01000	 I do go back home on Thursday night, but only so that I can get to the DFW airport Friday morning for my flight to Atlanta.
TrainSen	01000	 I am competing in a sports tournament for my church.
TrainSen	01000	 I am playing flag football and running track.
TrainSen	01000	 Another cool thing about this weekend get away is that I get to see the guy I've been dating for less than a month.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, I've known him for about 4 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together.
TrainSen	01000	 It's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13.
TrainSen	01000	 I went to a dance with him after that, but only because I didn't want to be mean.
TrainSen	01000	 He is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me.
TrainSen	01000	 That was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, I really don't care anymore.
TrainSen	01000	 He is the sweetest and funniest guy I have ever met.
TrainSen	01000	 I actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago.
TrainSen	01000	 Me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend.
TrainSen	01000	 A week after we broke things off, this new guy I'm dating told me he had feelings for me.
TrainSen	01000	 I was so confused and didn't know what to do because I had just got out of a relationship and I was going to be moving to Austin in a few weeks.
TrainSen	01000	 But I'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself.
TrainSen	01000	 Because of that, I decided that I'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy.
TrainSen	01000	 We decided we'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves.
TrainSen	01000	 My ex found out and was extremely jealous.
TrainSen	01000	 It just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy.
TrainSen	01000	 But oh well, that's life I guess.
TrainSen	01000	 I am really glad I continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say.
TrainSen	01000	 I spent every day with him until the day I left.
TrainSen	01000	 I have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much.
TrainSen	01000	 He is amazing.
TrainSen	01000	 The only thing I'm worried about is that I'll fall too hard and too quickly for him.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean I did just get out of a serious relationship and I don't think I'm quite ready for another one.
TrainSen	01000	 That's the only problem I'm having right now.
TrainSen	01000	 The fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to.
TrainSen	01000	 But the distance might become an issue.
TrainSen	01000	 It was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so I do feel a tad bit guilty that I'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex.
TrainSen	01000	 But my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me.
TrainSen	01000	 But yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at UT.
TrainSen	01000	 But I am definitely loving it here in Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 I enjoy all of my professors and classes.
TrainSen	01000	 Having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough.
TrainSen	01000	 In addition I am taking this psychology class, which I dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 Other than that I have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations.
TrainSen	01000	 I just finished the reading for that class right before I started this assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 Ah, my hands are still so cold.
TrainSen	01000	 What do I do?!  My ears are feeling very cold too.
TrainSen	01000	 Must I wear gloves in the summer in my DORM ROOM?!  Or my bad, it is the fall now.
TrainSen	01000	 Same thing.
TrainSen	01000	 Today is the day for my mile run.
TrainSen	01000	 Ever since I moved to Austin, I have been running a mile every other day at the Gregory Gym.
TrainSen	01000	 I absolutely love that place!  And it is so convenient because it is right next to Jester.
TrainSen	01000	 Freshman 15 can kiss my booty because I am staying in shape!  I find that I've been working out more here than I was doing at home in the summer.
TrainSen	01000	 I really love this lifestyle I have at UT.
TrainSen	01000	 The whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming, but I do not feel like I am abusing it.
TrainSen	01000	 I did party a lot this weekend, but I didn't drink or anything.
TrainSen	01000	 People keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't want people to view me as a party girl because I'm not out of control or anything.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 I see that this writing is almost up.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow this is actually a cool writing assignment.
TrainSen	00100	 I would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what I am thinking for a 20 minute period.
TrainSen	00100	 I have just gotten back from a meeting about the Texas Lonestars organization and LOVED it!  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing.
TrainSen	00100	 I am kind of stressed out (but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes) just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved.
TrainSen	00100	 Getting involved, however has never been a problem for me.
TrainSen	00100	 I love to be involved in everything.
TrainSen	00100	 Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue.
TrainSen	00100	 I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions.
TrainSen	00100	 I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the Steel Dance Company.
TrainSen	00100	 I am beginning to get nervous just because I haven't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I've been away from home.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that I am here to get an education, but it's obvious to everyone that college doesn't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career, but it's also a learning experience for life lessons.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined.
TrainSen	00100	      It has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new, huge city, but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of ""yey school is over"" to ""wow, my life is just beginning, along with lots of studying that I don't really want to do.
TrainSen	00100	 ""  My life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway.
TrainSen	00100	 I know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has.
TrainSen	00100	 The fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like I don't belong.
TrainSen	00100	 Yet, the funny thing is that I don't really care or maybe it's that I don't know how to make the effort to fit in again.
TrainSen	00100	 My first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that I've lived in for the past four years (even though I lived there when I was younger) and I feel like it will just be weird to see how my family's lives have just king of carried on without me.
TrainSen	00100	 I won't really understand my mom's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school.
TrainSen	00100	 My dad is perhaps the only one that I will probably still feel just about the same with because I am use to not seeing him all the time.
TrainSen	00100	 My time is almost up and as of right now I am just really hoping that, even though I may not be showing my priority to God right now, he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction.
TrainSen	01000	     Why don't the washing machines ever work in my dorm? I mean I swipe and swipe my student I'd and nothing.
TrainSen	01000	 Nothing ever starts up.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't carry change on me just because I know Ill spend it on dumb stuff, so I guess Ill never get my clothes washed.
TrainSen	01000	 Which is a really strange thing because back home I am so meticulous about being clean and having a something new to wear everyday.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't really care as much here.
TrainSen	01000	 I only care when I go out what I have on.
TrainSen	01000	 This is for the pure reason of wanting to impress males.
TrainSen	01000	 There is so many cute guys at UT, going out is soon going to be a problem if I don't get my all my work done.
TrainSen	01000	 I am so scared of not doing well in my classes.
TrainSen	01000	 This is the big times.
TrainSen	01000	 If I screw up here there may be no point of return.
TrainSen	01000	 Its either do it or get out.
TrainSen	01000	 There's like 10000 people here who are pre-med and I'm guessing 9999 of them are smarter than me, which really doesn't work in my favor when it comes to getting into med school.
TrainSen	01000	 Ah, why am I putting myself down!? I can do it.
TrainSen	01000	 I know I can, I've wanted this forever so I'm not going to just give up.
TrainSen	01000	 I really loathe calculus though.
TrainSen	01000	 I work so hard,and then I always seem to screw up the exams.
TrainSen	01000	 Why? I don't know, maybe I have testing anxiety? Is that really a real thing or is just some excuse I'm making up for my bad testing skills.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, whatever it is I need to get it under control.
TrainSen	01000	 My roommate seems to have everything under control.
TrainSen	01000	 She wakes up, makes her bed, goes to class, does 3 work out classes, eats fruits and vegetables for dinner, studies, then goes to sleep at 11 pm.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm like ""WOW"" here's the model student, so of course what do I do? I try to model her actions.
TrainSen	01000	 Yah, its not working so well.
TrainSen	01000	 I am just not such a structured person.
TrainSen	01000	 I do believe I have A.
TrainSen	01000	 D.
TrainSen	01000	 D though, or maybe once again this is just another excuse.
TrainSen	01000	 I just cannot focus on my reading assignments for more than like thirty minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 What's the deal? I have no idea.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh I have so much to do tomorrow, so many things to take care of .
TrainSen	01000	 I need to find out when my old professors office hours are this fall.
TrainSen	01000	 I really don't want to have to see him again, but its got to be done.
TrainSen	01000	 Especially if I want my grade fixed.
TrainSen	01000	 I hated my grades this summer.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe I let myself slip that low.
TrainSen	01000	 Well its really taught me a lesson.
TrainSen	01000	 I think.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean I am actually getting more studying done, or activities persay, such as this writing assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 But I still feel like the same old me.
TrainSen	01000	 Gosh, there this amazing jacket I want at the mall.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I just had an endless supply in my checking account.
TrainSen	01000	 But don't we all? Yah good thing I got a new job here.
TrainSen	01000	 My job is so badass.
TrainSen	01000	 Wait am I allowed to say ass in a school assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 hmmmm interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh well there's no going back now! But I do get paid a lot of money and that helps me a lot, because I am so expensive.
TrainSen	01000	 If I walk into a store, the only thing I'm going to like I can guarantee is going to the be the most money.
TrainSen	01000	 My room is so freezing cold.
TrainSen	01000	 I really need to find out if something can be done about this.
TrainSen	01000	 It's 60 degrees all the time, I'm sitting here in like my eskimo clothes in the middle of summer in texas.
TrainSen	01000	 It's ridiculous.
TrainSen	01000	 I really miss San Jac.
TrainSen	01000	 They had their own thermostats in each room.
TrainSen	01000	 It was clean.
TrainSen	01000	 And big.
TrainSen	01000	 Speaking of san jac.
TrainSen	01000	 Football season starts Saturday.
TrainSen	01000	 WOOHOO.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm the biggest dork, I get so into school events like that.
TrainSen	01000	 It just feelsreally cool to be a part of something so big.
TrainSen	01000	 It is sort of like when I'm walking past the tower and the mail bldg.
TrainSen	01000	 and I look down and see the capitol building.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm amazing, like ""wow, I really made it here!"" It's kind of surreal to me, like an out of body experience.
TrainSen	01000	 Then there is always the kids who make it look so easy to be here and like they don't give a damn, I'm like stop that! Exclamation marks make it look like I'm overly excited or yelling or something.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't like that so I won't use them any more.
TrainSen	01000	 Is this 20 min up yet? okay, I don't think I'm supposed to be thinking that.
TrainSen	01000	 Great now I've fallen into the trap of thinking about thinking of what to write for this paper.
TrainSen	01000	 I thought all day long about how to avoid this hole.
TrainSen	01000	 Yah it wasn't doable.
TrainSen	01000	 Is doable a word? do able.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know but I like using it.
TrainSen	01000	 uhhhh.
TrainSen	01000	 That's the sound of me going braindead.
TrainSen	01000	 Well not necessarily, that would mean I was dead and obviously I'm not because duh here I am typing.
TrainSen	01000	 I just really can't concentrate with my room being so cold.
TrainSen	01000	 My nose is like an icicle.
TrainSen	01000	 You know speaking of stream of consciousness, I have always wanted to read Ulysses.
TrainSen	01000	 Isn't that the name of the book by James Joyce ? Yah I read an excerpt from it and it was very intriguing.
TrainSen	01000	 They do this whole writing thing a lot better than I do.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm looking at my writing and I feel that I sound Childish, not intelligent, like I should be dictating more mature words.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh god there I go trying to sound smarter.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess all I can do is write what's in my head.
TrainSen	01000	 This is me, this is it.
TrainSen	01000	 Only like one more minute to go and thank goodness.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I've been having to force myself to think or something for the last twenty.
TrainSen	01000	 Plus I've been thinking in like turbo speed.
TrainSen	01000	 Sometimes I talk like that.
TrainSen	01000	 Very fast.
TrainSen	01000	 People can't understand me its horrible.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh damn my hand hurts so bad.
TrainSen	01000	 Ok good I am finally.
TrainSen	01000	 D-o-n-ne.
TrainSen	10000	What an evening!  I have every bad event that has taken place tonight on my mind right now because now I am in the worst mood.
TrainSen	10000	 I went with my suitemate to pick up food from Taco Cabana.
TrainSen	10000	 Everything was going good, but then we had to wait forever for our food.
TrainSen	10000	 Then when we got to the window, we had to send her drink back because it was the wrong size.
TrainSen	10000	 Finally, we got our food, and it was right.
TrainSen	10000	 We drove back to our dorm.
TrainSen	10000	 The Castilian has a very strange structure that they call their parking garage.
TrainSen	10000	 I park on the end of the row, and it is almost impossible to get in to.
TrainSen	10000	 After ten minutes, I finally got my car in my assigned spot.
TrainSen	10000	 When we were getting out, she grabbed the food and I grabbed the two drinks.
TrainSen	10000	 We had to wait forever forever for the parking garage elevator.
TrainSen	10000	 FInally, it came and we headed up to our room.
TrainSen	10000	 I stacked the two drinks on top of eachother and supported them with my chin as I attempted to unlock my door.
TrainSen	10000	 As I was doing this, I even heard my suitemate offer to hold the drinks while I opened the door, but I just ignored because I thought I had them.
TrainSen	10000	 I made it in the door successfully, but as I was going to set them down, I dropped both of them all over my area rug.
TrainSen	10000	 Irate, I bent over to pick up all of the ice on the floor and I screamed how much I really wanted a soda since I haven't had one all week!  I knew I had to get my rug washed otherwise it would be stained.
TrainSen	10000	 I proceeded to head down to the laundry room but realized I had forgotten the detergent.
TrainSen	10000	 All the while, keeping in my mind that my food was upstairs getting cold.
TrainSen	10000	 When I walked in to the laundry room, I whacked my hip bone on the door knob, and even as I type this, I can feel the bruise forming.
TrainSen	10000	 I kept walking towards the washing machines and didn't notice a puddle of water on the floor.
TrainSen	10000	 I slipped 3 times before making it to the machine.
TrainSen	10000	 I was so mad by this time that I just decided to wash my rug without any detergent.
TrainSen	10000	 Now, here I am sitting in my room so pissed about all the events.
TrainSen	10000	 I get back in my room and the internet is not working!!  I realize that I am so sick of fighting with the Apogee people that run our internet connections in our dorm.
TrainSen	10000	 So now, here I am eating the soggy nachos that I paid 6 bucks for.
TrainSen	10000	 All I can smell is the food, but now I'm really not hungry.
TrainSen	10000	 You should hear the neighbors across the hall making the situation all the more worse.
TrainSen	10000	 Their TV or radio is really loud and I can hear it from here.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh geez, now they're knocking on my door.
TrainSen	10000	 ""Is your internet working?""  It just came back up a few minutes ago is what I told them.
TrainSen	10000	 For a day that was going too good, it has now taken a turn for the worst.
TrainSen	10000	 Now I am thinking about the phone call I just made to my mom a little bit ago after all the excitement.
TrainSen	10000	 She did not offer me ANY words of advice!  ""Things happen!"" she said.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow!  No kidding!!  I don't think anything else can go wrong, unless my internet decides to cut off while I am writing this.
TrainSen	10000	 I look around my room and all I can see is a big mess!  As of right now, an optimistic attitude is way out of the question!  I'm seeing my WET school books on the ground as a result of the tumbling tower of drinks.
TrainSen	10000	 WOW!! I think this is the worst mood I've ever been in!  My room is freezing, my floor is wet, my rug is down in the dryer (which I have to go get in an hour--great!), and my neighbors are a pain in the rear.
TrainSen	10000	 My suitemate is playing sad music really loud and it is drifting in to my room.
TrainSen	10000	 It is reminding me of an ex-boyfriend that I have back home!  He acts so funny sometimes.
TrainSen	10000	 He thinks he is so hard to get when I know that when I go down there, he will come right back to me.
TrainSen	10000	 He's been acting like such a jerk to me lately along with all the other losers that live back home.
TrainSen	10000	 I was supposed to try to get a lot of things done on the internet tonight, as far as classes, and now I am completely set back.
TrainSen	10000	 Nursing homework, psych writing assignment, and retrieving bio notes were just a few of many things that I was supposed to do.
TrainSen	10000	 My stomach is growling because I am so mad.
TrainSen	10000	 It gets like this when things go wrong.
TrainSen	10000	 I HATE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG!!  My mom's words are ringing in my ears.
TrainSen	10000	 ""Things Happen!""  ""I just got done telling dad how good of a mood you sounded in when I talked to you earlier!""  THen come my suitemate's words.
TrainSen	00010	     it is often very cold in the Fac the smurf lab especially they call it the smurf lab because it's a student microcomputer facility the acronym and its meaning both absurdly out of date.
TrainSen	00010	 the computers are new and black the keys crunching crisply under my sore and tired fingers sore and tired from a 3 hour lab drawing three dimensional models in a computer, changing materials, trying to get travertine to stick to cool, airy software.
TrainSen	00010	 a man comes in (a boy a man) and sits at the computer I usually use but couldn't because his stuff was there.
TrainSen	00010	 he pulls a sandwich out of a bag, readjusts his hat, takes a slow bite of the sandwich and gets back to work chewing and biting calmly and contentedly as if preparing for a long night which will require nourishment of a complete sort.
TrainSen	00010	 complete nourishment completed with a drink of some brownish liquid like all other brownish liquids we drink as humans nearly indiscriminately.
TrainSen	00010	 4 minutes four minutes of aching arms and hands nerve cells firing the table to my brain, the itch on my right cheek to my brain, the cool air of the place to my brain.
TrainSen	00010	 I love to write.
TrainSen	00010	 I love to think in written form, to read the words in my brain, to think nothing but print if I can manage it.
TrainSen	00010	 Not just in a case like this as if I ever had a case like this - but in all of my life, my every day.
TrainSen	00010	 My speaking to others has quotation marks around it, descriptive ways of describing what I describe.
TrainSen	00010	 I always want to write discribe and I don't think I ever have until now because always my mind ( the silent one, the one that doesn't think in word sounds or print) my silent mind stops my hand and puts an e there because it's right, because I knew that from the beginning but the part of my brain that lives in kindergarten, brown bear brown bear what do you see? - tells me so.
TrainSen	00010	 No it tells me iiiii iii aye aye aye eye eye eye but it's eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
TrainSen	00010	 I live in an apartment on my own now I can barely get it out of my head because it was so beautiful when I moved in  bare clean white bright new and beautiful and I keep it so clean and I love that about the apartment and I love that about me.
TrainSen	00010	 I love to keep it all perfect.
TrainSen	00010	 any one in the world could walk in the door and other than my messy grammar of any one's and every thing's there would be nothing out of place.
TrainSen	00010	 I could open the door to the world and there is nothing shameful lying about no dirty plates and cups no clothes on the floor no mess around the sink.
TrainSen	00010	 It's all clean as I'd like my life to be and am so gradually making it.
TrainSen	00010	 The separation of church and state - the separation of method and emotion.
TrainSen	00010	 Somehow I now think of star trek - oh, vulcans.
TrainSen	00010	 Those crazy vulcans.
TrainSen	00010	 I loved the next generation but I could never stomach any of the other iterations- the other shows in the series.
TrainSen	00010	 The next generation was so right - picard so venerable, so rarely stooping to kirks weaknesses or the others' stupidities.
TrainSen	00010	 So french, so proud.
TrainSen	00010	 they made this archae not anthropological finding of some skull of some ancient form of man (in real life, not star trek) and they goyt got some graduate student or artist or pro or whatever to make a cast and then cover it with skin and eyes and hair to recreate the face of ancient man and it accidently turned out to look like patrick stewart and everyone thought hey ancient man looked like patrick stewart and they said no it didn't it's just a mistake but it was a great funny mistake anyway.
TrainSen	00010	 I think a lot about william and henry james.
TrainSen	00010	 I just read portrait of a lady over the summer and then to read ab out william in the psych book was so great so great to think that brothers could accomplish noteriety in separate fields to think that greatness was inherited from their father but they still so outshone him.
TrainSen	00010	 my father has a software company and employs a man named john stewart which I think of because of patrick.
TrainSen	00010	 He (john) drives a brand new red car red what corvette that's it.
TrainSen	00010	 a red corvette so new that at the corvette show they didn't have one and paid him to put it on display.
TrainSen	00010	 did they pay him?  my ear itches.
TrainSen	00010	 They used to say in elementary school if your ear itches someone is thinking about you who thinks about me.
TrainSen	00010	 The boy in the chair I usually sit in is thinking about me because I see him glance up from time to time in the corner of my eye.
TrainSen	00010	 He eats like a man watching football, chews with his mouth open swallows gulps too large to imagine.
TrainSen	00010	 so close to done and I loved doing this because I never write anymore.
TrainSen	00100	     So the first week of school has begun and I am not ready at all!  I already feel like I am loosing my mind.
TrainSen	00100	 Which is not a good way to start off the school year.
TrainSen	00100	 I am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors.
TrainSen	00100	 First, I am taking CMS 306M, which is a speech class, and that doesn't seem like it will be too hard.
TrainSen	00100	 Then I am taking ECO 304K with an amazing professor.
TrainSen	00100	 I am very excited about this class but I have heard that it is a little difficult so I will definatly have to pay attention and study.
TrainSen	00100	 I am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is Troy Kimmel-the weather man!  So I am excited about that because he seems like a fun person!  I am also taking EDP369K which is a community service class.
TrainSen	00100	 We have to do community service every week for at least 4 hours.
TrainSen	00100	 I think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business/place and get to experience those things that we normally wouldn't.
TrainSen	00100	 This class should be interesting.
TrainSen	00100	 I think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish.
TrainSen	00100	 This class is just something I need to take.
TrainSen	00100	 Finally, I am taking your PSY class which I am very excited about as well!  Pennebaker seems very laid back and cool.
TrainSen	00100	 With the music at the beginning of each class, etc.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know, I think I might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology (however that is spelled).
TrainSen	00100	 I really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon.
TrainSen	00100	 I am a sophomore so I am not as scared as I was last year.
TrainSen	00100	 Last year I was very intimidated so I studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way-and in return I ended up with a 3.
TrainSen	00100	 888 (which my parents are enthused about!)  But this year I am not as intimidated, so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing.
TrainSen	00100	 I just really need to get out of the summer mode where I go out every night and do nothing but work and party.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to calm down and study/read a bit more than I am now.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days.
TrainSen	00100	 So hopefully Ill get my act together soon.
TrainSen	00100	 Anyway, on a lighter note tonight was our first Chapter Meeting.
TrainSen	00100	 That's right, I am in a sorority-Alpha Chi Omega-and I love it!  We just went through RUSH where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 My little Alpha Sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever!  She knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time!  I just love her.
TrainSen	00100	 Next week we get our Chi Sis' and then a few weeks after that we get our Omega Sis' then at the end of that we get to chooose our Lil' Sis'-which will be ours for the rest of our college years.
TrainSen	00100	 So this semester should be very exciting!  This year I am living in the AXO house with my pledge class of '03 and I wasn't so sure about it last year but I really love it!  I am getting to know my Pledge Class SO much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters-however corny that may sound!  Haha.
TrainSen	00100	 Anywho, we have a date dash on Thursday and I am not sure which boy to take!  haha.
TrainSen	00100	 I always seem to have boy problems.
TrainSen	00100	 But o well, that's all part of being a college student (I guess).
TrainSen	00100	 Anywho, there is this one boy who is a Sigma Chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around.
TrainSen	00100	 And really cute but then there is a Wrangler whos name is Matt who I kind of talked to last semester.
TrainSen	00100	 He use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started.
TrainSen	00100	 Well even though he may be good to look at he really doesn't have much of a personality!  Which really sucks.
TrainSen	00100	 I think he's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and doesn't have a whole lotta interesting things to say.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean, don't get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and I tottally trust him.
TrainSen	00100	 And he's 21 (haha).
TrainSen	00100	 But I can't help it if I am not attracted to someone.
TrainSen	00100	 I mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at.
TrainSen	00100	 But in a way I feel like I owe it to him to invite him to our date dash.
TrainSen	00100	 But then again I don't want to lead him on and then ""break"" his heart.
TrainSen	00100	 Because that's just cruel!  Okay, then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex-boyfriend (but in a good way).
TrainSen	00100	 He is super cute and very interesting.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I could hold several very interesting/intelligent conversations with him.
TrainSen	00100	 I think he could teach me a lot about life in general.
TrainSen	00100	 Anywho, my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this Date Dash and I would LOVe to go with him but I feel like I owe it to these other guys, that I have been spending more time with.
TrainSen	00100	 So right now I am a very confussed person-and considering it is Monday night I kind of need to make up my mind really fast.
TrainSen	00100	 Okay, so there's the Sigma Chi-names Forest-who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long-term quality.
TrainSen	00100	 Then there's Matt-the Wrangler-who is so nice but I would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him.
TrainSen	00100	 Then there is Ryan who is someone I look very much foward to getting to know better.
TrainSen	00100	 So we shall see how things go.
TrainSen	00100	 I know everything happens for a reason so I will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out!  Right??  Well, I have now been typing non-stop for 18 minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess I had a lot to get off of my cheast.
TrainSen	00100	 This is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day.
TrainSen	00100	 just let it all out!  Haha, good idea!  O yeah, I tried signing up for an experiment project but then I realized I signed up for the wrong day so I hope that doesn't affect my grade.
TrainSen	00100	 Whopps!  O well, there's nothing I can do about that now.
TrainSen	10000	    Stream of Consciousness:  That time counter is very annoying, the videos that switched.
TrainSen	10000	 a really good song just came on, I think it is by Mark Anthony.
TrainSen	10000	 This office smells kind of funny sometimes.
TrainSen	10000	 I met this Girl named Maria today and she is a runner for UT.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope Parking and Transportstion appeals my ticket.
TrainSen	10000	 I have some really random thoughts.
TrainSen	10000	  I want the best things out of life.
TrainSen	10000	 But I fear that I want too much!  What if I fall flat on my face and don't amount to anything.
TrainSen	10000	 But I feel like I was born to do BIG things on this earth.
TrainSen	10000	 But who knows.
TrainSen	10000	  There is this Persian party today.
TrainSen	10000	 My neck hurts.
TrainSen	10000	 But I am excited about attending this party.
TrainSen	10000	 The girl I like will be there.
TrainSen	10000	 She is my ex.
TrainSen	10000	 Btu it's all good.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope she still has feeling for me.
TrainSen	10000	 I woke up this morning with a terrible head ache.
TrainSen	10000	  I am wondering if I should invite my brother and hos friends to that party.
TrainSen	10000	 I really wasn't invited myself, but I know Marjon will be there.
TrainSen	10000	 I have some messages on my phone.
TrainSen	10000	 How do you track feelings?  That must be hard to do.
TrainSen	10000	 I feel good!  Healthy, kind of tired - but its morning time.
TrainSen	10000	 I should call Janaina.
TrainSen	10000	 I miss her.
TrainSen	10000	 She is very cool.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope no one actually wastes their time reading this.
TrainSen	10000	 Because this stream of consciouness in BS.
TrainSen	10000	 But it's ok.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I will learn something new from this class.
TrainSen	10000	 I made a taks sheet for today.
TrainSen	10000	 But I dought (is that how you spell that word?) I will finish everything on there.
TrainSen	10000	 But I might.
TrainSen	10000	 Life is much simpler when you have direction.
TrainSen	10000	  I need to get stated on my well logging  homework.
TrainSen	10000	 I bet you guys don't even read this paper.
TrainSen	10000	 I would be interested in seeing how people stucture this writing assignment.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean, the way people form their paragraphs and stuff.
TrainSen	10000	 As you can see I like writing paragraphs 3-4 sentences at a  time.
TrainSen	10000	 Yeahhhhhhhhhhh, time is almost up.
TrainSen	10000	 I am very glda to be done with is assignment.
TrainSen	01000	I'm thinking about bush and religion.
TrainSen	01000	 I just had a simi arguement about it.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't really care for the way the government is trying to impose religion on everyone.
TrainSen	01000	 country music isn't that bad.
TrainSen	01000	 I use to hate it in high school and now I've found a liking for it.
TrainSen	01000	 tomorrow I go to nachadoches to visit friends.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm looking forward to the driving and getting away from it all.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't like being stuck down here.
TrainSen	01000	 my room is really quiet.
TrainSen	01000	 so is my roommate.
TrainSen	01000	 we don't talk much.
TrainSen	01000	 hopefully we'll open up and start to talk a bit.
TrainSen	01000	 my legs itch and so does my back.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm really full.
TrainSen	01000	 that large pizza was really good.
TrainSen	01000	 but the sight of pizza would make me really sick.
TrainSen	01000	 I still can't stop thinking about government.
TrainSen	01000	 it all just sickens me.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish there were better canidates to choose from.
TrainSen	01000	 face itches.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm actually happy tonite.
TrainSen	01000	 I got an A on my physics homework.
TrainSen	01000	 ugh, physics was made by the devil, I swear.
TrainSen	01000	 its like they don't want you to ever pass that class.
TrainSen	01000	 leg itches.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm a little stressed though.
TrainSen	01000	 my shoulders and neck are all tight.
TrainSen	01000	 I think its because of my whole financial aid deal.
TrainSen	01000	 hopefully it will all be in by tomorrow so I can have some money for this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 arm itches.
TrainSen	01000	 I really like country music.
TrainSen	01000	 stomach itches.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss old friends.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe ill try to fix that this semester.
TrainSen	01000	 get back in contact with old friends or try to stay in contact.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to stop missing calculus class.
TrainSen	01000	 its not like its hard.
TrainSen	01000	 I just need to go and pay attention.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to shave.
TrainSen	01000	 I just need the time to do it.
TrainSen	01000	 it takes forever.
TrainSen	01000	 my chair is comfy.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't like how my monitor is set-up.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I didn't have to turn my neck to look at the monitor.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder who is winning the patriots/colts game.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope the colts win.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't want to see the pats win anymore.
TrainSen	01000	 I really like the underdogs, except when its UT playing.
TrainSen	01000	 got to support the home team.
TrainSen	01000	 astros finally lost a game.
TrainSen	01000	 12 straight and then a lose.
TrainSen	01000	 hope they won the second game of the doubleheader.
TrainSen	01000	 now I see why I people don't like country music, it puts you in a more mellow mood.
TrainSen	01000	 not sad but not happy.
TrainSen	01000	 more of a reflective mood.
TrainSen	01000	 man, this summer was awesome.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait til next summer.
TrainSen	01000	 college intern at cypress united methodist.
TrainSen	01000	 200 kids, wow! a girl from katy died today.
TrainSen	01000	 some people from the mission trip knew her.
TrainSen	01000	 its so sad to be taken at such a young age.
TrainSen	01000	 texas better beat arkansas Saturday.
TrainSen	01000	 ill be pissed if they lose again to them.
TrainSen	01000	 I itch a lot.
TrainSen	01000	 my beard especially.
TrainSen	01000	 that's why I need to shave it.
TrainSen	01000	 ugh, 8am class tomorrow.
TrainSen	01000	 I thought freshman year was going to be the only year I had them.
TrainSen	01000	 oh well, the class is easy and entertaining.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait for this to be over.
TrainSen	01000	 I really wish me and my roommate would talk more.
TrainSen	01000	 it gets kind of akward in here when we are just sitting at our computers not talking to each other.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to excercise.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm feeling lazy.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to play raquetball.
TrainSen	01000	 it was great when I hit ash in the head with the ball and then when I fell on my butt when trying to serve.
TrainSen	01000	 great times.
TrainSen	01000	 my beard still itches.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I'm going to go shave soon.
TrainSen	01000	 its driving me nuts.
TrainSen	01000	 this is a lot like writing in a journal.
TrainSen	01000	 just a lot more random.
TrainSen	01000	 but being random is fun, it throws people off.
TrainSen	00010	Right now I am in my apartment with my two room mates and one of their girlalking to the friend and her friend.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate is wistling some weird tune while watching seinfeld and talking to the girls.
TrainSen	00010	 My computer is writing unbelievably slow because of all these unbelievably uneccessary pop-ups.
TrainSen	00010	 Speaking of unbelievable, how do you spell it?  Is it with an ie of ei whatever I guess it really doesn't matter.
TrainSen	00010	 I just answered the door and signed for some package for my roommate.
TrainSen	00010	 The delivery guy was chill, I like UPS.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate just put on a Dave Matthews dvd so at least I'm listening to some pretty sweet music.
TrainSen	00010	 I am currently eating a cliff bar flavored chocalate brownie.
TrainSen	00010	 It looks like predigested food, but at leats it taste fairly good.
TrainSen	00010	 I just looked to my right and noticed my bike which I have not ridden since I got to Austin.
TrainSen	00010	 Its a Hoffman Condor, which is a pretty sweet bike, I guess I should use it a little more.
TrainSen	00010	 Me and my roommates rode are bikes around in the snow last year up in Chicago, that was tight.
TrainSen	00010	 You would never imagine how hard it is to ride a bike on a frozen pond.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommates girlfriend is doing her laundry at our apartment right now.
TrainSen	00010	 Its cool.
TrainSen	00010	 I just looked at my other roommate and thought about the incredibly easy week he has had.
TrainSen	00010	 He goes to ACC and has no friday classes.
TrainSen	00010	 He then skipped monday because he didn't have his car.
TrainSen	00010	 Today he got out of both of his classes for some carnival they were having.
TrainSen	00010	 He just asked me ""Travis where are we eating tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 ""  That kind of funny because that for sure seems like the most important thing we have to do tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 I love college.
TrainSen	00010	 Dave is now playing Granny on the listener supported dvd and its kickin.
TrainSen	00010	 I love this song.
TrainSen	00010	 Dave and his boys rock it out in concert if you have never been.
TrainSen	00010	 .
TrainSen	00010	 GGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOO.
TrainSen	00010	 UT is turning out to be pretty sweet.
TrainSen	00010	 I love the wide variety of people you get to see on a daily basis.
TrainSen	00010	 My last school had 1200 students so I Knew just about everyone I saw, its a little different here, but its all good.
TrainSen	00010	 Just looked at the timer and it looks like I got about 3 minutes left.
TrainSen	00010	 Is anyone elses computer typing on like a 2 second delay?  Anyway its been fun writing in a constant stream of continual conscience or whatever its called.
TrainSen	00010	 Phsycology is very interesting I really liked the lie detector test.
TrainSen	00010	 Props to Michael for tricking that thing the second time around.
TrainSen	00010	 Just looked at the kitchen, it looks pretty clean who would have thought?  One minute left that's really all I'm thinking about right now.
TrainSen	00010	 The class dj is good with the tunes they seem to be a sweet mix.
TrainSen	00010	 Talk to you later peace out whoever is reading this.
TrainSen	00010	 Bye.
TrainSen	01000	Today has been so uneventful.
TrainSen	01000	 I just accidentally pushed the finish button on this thing and I hadn't typed a thing.
TrainSen	01000	 My roommate has her volume all the way up on her computer and is IMing people and it is quite annoying.
TrainSen	01000	 *Bahhhring!* Ugh.
TrainSen	01000	 I just watched this movie that I completely did not understand.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not sure exactly what was going on the whole time.
TrainSen	01000	 Something about this guy who was really screwed up and then he killed his mom.
TrainSen	01000	 But she wanted him to.
TrainSen	01000	 Weird.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm so tired right now, but I have an early 9 o'clock class.
TrainSen	01000	 I have towels in the drier.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't forget to take them out.
TrainSen	01000	 They're pink and have my name monogramed on them in bright green.
TrainSen	01000	 Cute.
TrainSen	01000	 I think, anyways.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't stop thinking about Ronnie.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate being in a long distance relationship.
TrainSen	01000	 I really do.
TrainSen	01000	 I saw him just yesterday, and he is coming to visit again on Saturday, but it is still too much time in between.
TrainSen	01000	 I just miss him so much.
TrainSen	01000	 He means everything to me.
TrainSen	01000	 He's my best friend.
TrainSen	01000	 He's my boyfriend.
TrainSen	01000	 He's everything.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I don't talk to my mom as much as I should, but I really don't feel compelled.
TrainSen	01000	 And when I do talk to her, she always thinks I am upset about something, but I'm not.
TrainSen	01000	 I just don't have a lot to say.
TrainSen	01000	 She is usually busy anyways.
TrainSen	01000	 Any forty-one-year-old with a kid in college and a one and a half year old, and a live-in, senile grandmother generally has a lot on her plate.
TrainSen	01000	 And my step-dad, not like he counts for anything.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't stand the man.
TrainSen	01000	 And she wonders why I was always miserable when I lived with her.
TrainSen	01000	 He's such a jerk.
TrainSen	01000	 But I don't have to live with him now.
TrainSen	01000	 College life is so much different, but I think I will like it, aside from being away from Ronnie.
TrainSen	01000	 I like being on my own and not having to worry about what every one else thinks all the time.
TrainSen	01000	 Especially my step-dad.
TrainSen	01000	 I do miss Ronnie though.
TrainSen	01000	 Seeing him this weekend was so amazing.
TrainSen	01000	 I had only been away from him for a week, but it seemed like an eternity longer, I guess because we had taken this huge leap in our lives, moving away and all.
TrainSen	01000	 I still can't believe it.
TrainSen	01000	 My life at home was always so monotomous.
TrainSen	01000	 Get dressed, school, newspaper, home, dinner, Ronnie, home, computer, sleep.
TrainSen	01000	 Day in, day out.
TrainSen	01000	 Now all I do is homework, but still, it's a change (haha, like I ever did homework in high school!) I just realized that I can finally type without looking at the keys.
TrainSen	01000	 I hadn't known that before.
TrainSen	01000	 Of course, now that I notice this, I keep messing up, but I guess that's because I am concentrating too hard.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm trying to teach my mom to type not in all capital letters all the time.
TrainSen	01000	 That's so annoying.
TrainSen	01000	 Of course, now she types in all lower case, but still that's a step up from reading EVERYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
TrainSen	01000	 Caps hurt my eyes and run together.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow, this really is a random paper.
TrainSen	01000	 I went to Baylor this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 I could never go to that school.
TrainSen	01000	 They have chapel every morning at 8.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow, that's early.
TrainSen	01000	 And they have community bathrooms.
TrainSen	01000	 And, their dorms are small.
TrainSen	01000	 I like my dorm at Dobie.
TrainSen	01000	 It's nice and spacious, for a dorm anyhow.
TrainSen	01000	 A whole lot better than Jester.
TrainSen	01000	 I would hate to live in that cramped little space.
TrainSen	01000	 Gross.
TrainSen	01000	 And their bathrooms are gross because ditzy little girls are always getting too drunk and puking everywhere.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, the life a sorority hopeful.
TrainSen	01000	 How I envy puking all over the place in front of everyone.
TrainSen	01000	 My suitemate puked this weekend because she got too drunk.
TrainSen	01000	 I've never been drunk, don't plan on being that way.
TrainSen	01000	 It just doesn't appeal to me.
TrainSen	01000	 In the cafeteria they had corn nuggets.
TrainSen	01000	 Ronnie and I were talking about those just the other day.
TrainSen	01000	 They used to have them at Church's Chicken and we both loved them, but now they don't anymore.
TrainSen	01000	 But they have them in the cafeteria! That's about the only decent thing they have.
TrainSen	01000	 Unless you're into greasy casserole or soggy bagels.
TrainSen	01000	 I for one am not.
TrainSen	01000	 I am so sleepy, and I think I might go to bed early tonight.
TrainSen	01000	 But I need to remember my towels in the dryer.
TrainSen	01000	 I bet they'll turn the next person's laundry pink, but hopefully not.
TrainSen	01000	 I've washed them before.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to call Ronnie after I get done with this.
TrainSen	01000	 I told him I'd call when Leslie left.
TrainSen	01000	 Leslie's gone.
TrainSen	01000	 I bet he is busy though.
TrainSen	01000	 His classes began today.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, man.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss him and talk about him way too much.
TrainSen	01000	 Is that bad? I really think we can make it though.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean, if the world is like it should, he and I will be together.
TrainSen	01000	 We just will.
TrainSen	01000	 Every time I look down at the beautiful ring on my finger, (on my RIGHT hand), I just know it'll be okay.
TrainSen	01000	 But I do miss him.
TrainSen	01000	 I transferred into Comm school today.
TrainSen	01000	 Leslie says I am a Commie now, just like her.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess this is something to be happy about.
TrainSen	01000	 This is what I've wanted for a long time.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, my time is almost up.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow, twenty minutes goes fast when you don't talk about anything but yourself.
TrainSen	01000	 Shameless self-infatuation.
TrainSen	01000	     I'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because I attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 19:59.
TrainSen	01000	 very ironic.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel very tired right now and really unmotivated.
TrainSen	01000	 I have a lot to do and I don't feel like doing anything.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I could just go to sleep.
TrainSen	01000	 I need a lot of attention from people these days and I'm just not getting it.
TrainSen	01000	 matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it.
TrainSen	01000	 seems very convinient of him but whatever.
TrainSen	01000	 he is acting weird, and different but he doesn't know or doesn't see what he's doing.
TrainSen	01000	 it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and I'm slowly beginning to not care.
TrainSen	01000	 but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school, sleep, and me then to the things that he is focusing on.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe I'm just overreacting though, because I seem to do that so well.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't feel like being here, my head hurts, and I smell burnt popcorn in the hall way.
TrainSen	01000	 I have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 5.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know what the day will have in store for me, hopefully I will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that's bothering me.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to realize that I can make myself happy and I don't need someone else to make me happy.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't even know why I'm rambling on about this, its just always in my head I suppose.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I get a new car.
TrainSen	01000	 my dad said I can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance.
TrainSen	01000	 but who knows what kind of car he's going to get me.
TrainSen	01000	 It will probably be something crappy like I have now.
TrainSen	01000	 but I can't complain, something is definatly better than nothing, at least in this case.
TrainSen	01000	 my economics book came in today.
TrainSen	01000	 finally, becasue I was starting to stress that I was going to get too far behind.
TrainSen	01000	 I really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything.
TrainSen	01000	 even though I do try but I need more.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to focus on doing that for all of my classes.
TrainSen	01000	 but economics and chemistry are the main ones that I might have difficulty in.
TrainSen	01000	 just because they are very mathy subjects.
TrainSen	01000	 I might stay at the appartment tonight but I probably won't because I have such an early class tomorrow.
TrainSen	01000	 well see what happens I suppose.
TrainSen	01000	 I think matts court started already and he didn't even call me to let me know that he got to town safely.
TrainSen	01000	 oh well, like I said I'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things.
TrainSen	01000	 that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all, about anything.
TrainSen	01000	 it feels bad to feel like you're on the back burner, or that things have changed, though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm so tired right now I could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow.
TrainSen	01000	 but I can't do that because I have entirely too much work to do.
TrainSen	01000	 tonight I want to get caught up with my psychology eradings, and I want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two.
TrainSen	01000	 my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope all of that works out ok.
TrainSen	01000	 if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but I'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me.
TrainSen	01000	 I just hope it counts to him.
TrainSen	01000	 oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 I met with my mentor group earlier.
TrainSen	01000	 they're all really nice people and I hope I get to know them a lot better as the year progresses.
TrainSen	01000	 its a pretty fun experience.
TrainSen	01000	 this weekend should be fun.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san Marcos and go see some people that I haven't seen in a long time.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I can scrounge up something to wear, because I need to do laundry and I need to go shopping,  I have like no clothes anymore, I don't know what happened.
TrainSen	01000	 my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if I see her this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 I hinestly don't feel like going home though.
TrainSen	01000	 it gets too awkward for me.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know what but I don't really like it.
TrainSen	01000	 I'd rather just stay here and study or like watch TV then go home and feel awkward with my family.
TrainSen	01000	 I have so much to do and I'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun.
TrainSen	01000	 I can already see that college is going to be very hectic.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I can handle it alright.
TrainSen	01000	 wow the time is up.
TrainSen	01000	     So it is cold in my room it was like that last night too.
TrainSen	01000	 I really have to go to the bathroom.
TrainSen	01000	 wow I suck at typing I think it is because my fingers are cold.
TrainSen	01000	 my feet are also cold too.
TrainSen	01000	 I can hear the air conditioning blowing over my bed and my room.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm so full right now-I just had lunch and it was good, but I was starving.
TrainSen	01000	 Absolutely starting.
TrainSen	01000	 I have this class today and I hope I don't fall asleep.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't think I will because it is usually entertaining.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I am doing this right.
TrainSen	01000	 Since I am typing, I am focusing on that and not on my main stream thoughts.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope my friend Kacie is doing ok, she doesn't like her roommate and wants to transfer to Colorado where her brother goes to school.
TrainSen	01000	 I can picture her sitting in her dorm all alone right now.
TrainSen	01000	 Juliana is funny.
TrainSen	01000	 we usually eat lunch together and it is fun.
TrainSen	01000	 she is quiet and a lot of people might think she was a snob, but she isn't,just shy.
TrainSen	01000	 TOnight I have a meeting to go to for 2 hours.
TrainSen	01000	 that sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if my parents are going to come to UT this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 They said they might, but I'm going to the game on Saturday and I won't be in town on Sunday, so I guess we will see.
TrainSen	01000	 Did I mention I have to pee?  I think I did.
TrainSen	01000	 I took my ipod to class today, to biology, and listened to it on the way.
TrainSen	01000	 It worked fine except I kind of felt like a snobby -conspicuous consumption- person while I was listening to my music.
TrainSen	01000	 The white earpieces give it away.
TrainSen	01000	 Everyone knows its an Ipod.
TrainSen	01000	 I always am picturing the bus stop I walk past to get to class.
TrainSen	01000	 how everyone is standing outside, waiting for the bus, the shadow of the trees' leaves on the ground in the hot August sun.
TrainSen	01000	 Haha, I feel like I'm writing some romance novel or something.
TrainSen	01000	 I have a lot of homework to do today, and I didn't do much last night.
TrainSen	01000	 Now the refrigerator is making noises, but it always does.
TrainSen	01000	 I think my roommate is at class.
TrainSen	01000	 I haven't seen her at all today.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder what people downstairs are doing.
TrainSen	01000	 this kid thought I was going to eat lunch with him because we just happened to leave the dorm at the same time to go to Kinsolving, but then I was meeting my friend.
TrainSen	01000	 So I feel kind of bad, but he went on ahead too.
TrainSen	01000	 Its not totally my fault.
TrainSen	01000	 Some of my high school friends are out of school now.
TrainSen	01000	 I have class till 5 then the NSC meeting till 7.
TrainSen	01000	 blah.
TrainSen	01000	 And I have a meeting tomorrow night, and a couple next week.
TrainSen	01000	 This feels like high school again.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope people will wait for me to go to dinner with them.
TrainSen	01000	 Last night we went to jack in the box, and I hate fast food, so I got a salad.
TrainSen	01000	 That's what I got when we went to Burger King last week, also.
TrainSen	01000	 I would rahter eat at kinsolving then waste my Bevo Bucks there.
TrainSen	01000	 Mmm.
TrainSen	01000	 Thai food sounds good.
TrainSen	01000	 My nutrition class is so boring.
TrainSen	01000	 Today at lunch while I got my tacos and was fixing them, and while I got my fruit, I was thinking of my nutrition class and our teacher lecturing on and on.
TrainSen	01000	 About fruits, vegetables, the servings we ned to have of each, that kind of of thing.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm really tired all the sudden.
TrainSen	01000	 My eyes are starting to close.
TrainSen	01000	 I could take a nap before psych.
TrainSen	01000	 But I probably won't.
TrainSen	01000	 So I still have to pee.
TrainSen	01000	 That's kind of gross and you won't want to know that but oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 All my friends keep signing on to I'M but I can't talk to them because I am doing this.
TrainSen	01000	 only 10 min.
TrainSen	01000	 left! This reminds me of jogging on the treadmill at Gregory, with other sweating people watching Ellen or Regis and Kelly in the morning.
TrainSen	01000	 I keep looking at the clock, praying the time will go faster so I will be done working out.
TrainSen	01000	 Should I join crew? I might, my roommate is involved, and it would be a good way to work out, and it would be done so early in the morning.
TrainSen	01000	 I just hesitate because I don't want to be exhausted all the time, which I could very well be.
TrainSen	01000	 My friend James goes to OSU and he had a fro last year but he shaved it this summer.
TrainSen	01000	 I like it better with the fro because he is a funny kid.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm getting tired of this.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't want Carpel Tunnel Syndrome or anything.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't think I have actually ever typed for like 20 min at a time.
TrainSen	01000	 the girl across the hall from me isn't very friendly.
TrainSen	01000	 She is in my bio and chem classes and in my FIG also, but she seems kind of snobby and all like ""I'm too good to talk to you"".
TrainSen	01000	 I keep thinking of my friend from HS who is in the psych class too.
TrainSen	01000	 I saw her as we walked out on Monday and  I was like oh, hey.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm thinking about breaking out my Thin Mints that my mom sent me right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I wanted a cookie at lunch but they had cake.
TrainSen	01000	 And cookies are so good.
TrainSen	01000	 FOr some reason Kerry just popped into my head.
TrainSen	01000	 what should I do about that? Should I vote for him?  I think it was because we did a psych.
TrainSen	01000	 survey yesterday about Bush and terrorism.
TrainSen	01000	 My fridge stopped making noises but the a.
TrainSen	01000	 C still is.
TrainSen	01000	 My arms are starting to hurt.
TrainSen	01000	 Am I going to die? This weekend my brother and his wife came in town from Boston for a wedding and we hung out with him.
TrainSen	01000	 We went to Barton Springs, it was fun.
TrainSen	01000	 After, we got some tacos at this place for lunch.
TrainSen	01000	 It was good.
TrainSen	01000	 I can see us in line at the restaurant (as a baby I called it a restoot) waiting to order, me looking around, deciding what to get, if I wanted the drinks that were really good, they taste just like a fruit.
TrainSen	01000	 We got a cantolope one and it was so refreshing.
TrainSen	01000	 I have the worst posture.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm trying to sit up now.
TrainSen	01000	 My friend kc has a yoga strap she uses to keep her sitting up straight.
TrainSen	01000	 Owww.
TrainSen	01000	 my arms really hurt now.
TrainSen	01000	 oh band, I was in band last year and I remember marching and all those friends I had from band.
TrainSen	01000	 One of my friends who is a senior now has to go to practice today.
TrainSen	01000	 He just signed online.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow, only 2 more minutes!  Someone is slamming doors in my hall and I can hear people talking.
TrainSen	01000	 There are some really annoying sorority girls and frat boys in my hall and they think they are so cool.
TrainSen	01000	 One girl has they shorts that say sexy on the butt, and she is also in one of my classes.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not a huge fan of her.
TrainSen	01000	 wow, that's mean.
TrainSen	01000	 me just rambling on about the people I don't like.
TrainSen	01000	 Ok, almost there.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I'm running a marathon.
TrainSen	01000	 I ran this morning.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm proud of myself for exercising so hopefully I won't gain the freshman 500000.
TrainSen	01000	 Then you would have to roll me home.
TrainSen	01000	 I can imagine, rolling myself home past the Buccees in Giddings, the Exxon station and the little Beaver (Buccee himself) on the Exxon sign.
TrainSen	01000	 ok I'm done, ow my arms hurt.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm such a wimp.
TrainSen	01000	 Now my prof is going to read this out loud and I'm going to be mortified, sinking lower and lower in my seat.
TrainSen	01000	 please don't read aloud! haha.
TrainSen	01000	 I know that won't happen.
TrainSen	01000	 ok bye.
TrainSen	00010	What do I write about? That is a good question, but I guess I should write about writing, or think about thinking.
TrainSen	00010	 The thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued I am at the moment.
TrainSen	00010	 I have been running around all day doing errands for the actives, and I just want to sit and do nothing.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts.
TrainSen	00010	 Part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music.
TrainSen	00010	 Jimmy Buffet is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I were sleeping and I wish I did not have to report to the house in about 40 minutes because I just want to do nothing right now.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued.
TrainSen	00010	 I did not have much class today, so I got to sleep in, but I could still use some rest.
TrainSen	00010	 Perhaps I need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future.
TrainSen	00010	 I just don't have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class.
TrainSen	00010	 I have been in school here for about two weeks, and I think it is really quite a cool set up.
TrainSen	00010	 You don't have to go to class if you don't want to, but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence.
TrainSen	00010	 Sometimes the lectures are really quite boring, but this is never the case in Psychology, only my other classes.
TrainSen	00010	 The biggest adjustment I think from High school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade.
TrainSen	00010	 One of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball.
TrainSen	00010	 That guy is such a mess and I was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool, but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer.
TrainSen	00010	 Let's see here, it has been 11 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun.
TrainSen	00010	 It is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human.
TrainSen	00010	 I am trying to search for thoughts, but I just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption, just natural thoughts.
TrainSen	00010	 All of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and ""margaritaville.
TrainSen	00010	 ""  I wish I were on the beach right now instead of at school, but its not all that bad.
TrainSen	00010	 We have our own semi- beach environment with the river and other stuff around Austin.
TrainSen	00010	 But now my hands are kind of aching because I don't think I have ever typed this long without taking a break.
TrainSen	00010	 I am certain that I wil have great stamina in my hands when I am through with all of the writing assignments, and if it does nothing else, atleast my typing speed should increase significantly.
TrainSen	00010	 It is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days  because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music.
TrainSen	00010	 I like this serenity with just me, my computer, and jimmy.
TrainSen	00010	 I look up at the clock and see I am at the eighteen minute mark, and only two more minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which I have 20 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong.
TrainSen	00010	 This writing is not so painful as I though because I was sure that I would just go braindead and have nothing to say.
TrainSen	00010	 I do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing.
TrainSen	00010	 Looks like I am  out of time.
TrainSen	00010	     Ok, writing.
TrainSen	00010	 I started this a few minutes ago but apparently in Mozilla Firefox the timer doesn't work.
TrainSen	00010	 Sorry if I end up submitting two essays.
TrainSen	00010	 Right now I'm kind of hungry.
TrainSen	00010	 My stomach is growling, I haven't eaten since seven-thirty this morning.
TrainSen	00010	 I didn't use to eat breakfast, but now I do.
TrainSen	00010	 One minute down.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel pressured, like I have to continue hitting keys or I'm not doing as well as I should on this writing assignment.
TrainSen	00010	 Which is strange because all I have to do is write something, anything, and I get credit for it.
TrainSen	00010	 Is it cheating if I use the backspace key to edit my mistakes?  There are quite a few of them.
TrainSen	00010	 I probably would type better and therefore faster if I slowed down, which is paradoxical but true.
TrainSen	00010	 I am also sleepy.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe I will take a nap, except I have to study.
TrainSen	00010	 Hooray.
TrainSen	00010	 That's a thing about college that is hard to get used to - setting oneself to a schedule and keeping to it, studying and going to classes on time without being told what to do.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm thinking about psychology and the hypothalamus, which is what we learned about yesterday.
TrainSen	00010	 The description of the rat kind of makes me wish I was a rat whose hypothalamus was being zapped.
TrainSen	00010	 Seems kind of nice, although dying of starvation doesn't sound pleasant.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe in this case it does.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what it's like.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe conscious though takes a backseat to simple feelings of pleasure, like humans feel sometimes, in the throes of ecstasy (religious, sexual, or chemical).
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe the human brain has a natural resistance to feeling too much for too long in order to protect itself from things like dying of pleasure.
TrainSen	00010	 Quite a way to go.
TrainSen	00010	 I am running out of things to write about and it's only been 5:30 minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 My mind is becoming a blank.
TrainSen	00010	 Perhaps I can shove something in there.
TrainSen	00010	 Nope.
TrainSen	00010	 Rub a dub dub, three men in a tub.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm regressing back to childhood, oh no!  Forced constant thinking seems to have brought me back to my childhood, which is not what I would have expected.
TrainSen	00010	 If you think about it, that nursery rhyme is kind of suggestive.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder why I keep bringing up images and thoughts from when I was young?  Perhaps those, being learned first, form the basis of the psyche and are therefore more intrinsic to the mind than say, what I learned yesterday or what I see on MTV.
TrainSen	00010	 MTV.
TrainSen	00010	 I do not like that channel at all.
TrainSen	00010	 I do not like it in a boat, I do not like it with a goat.
TrainSen	00010	 I do not like it, Sam I Am, I do not like Music Television.
TrainSen	00010	 The channel that proclaims to be that of rebels and anti-culturalists, but is really the mainstream mass-produced mass-consumed product that everyone thinks it is rebelling against.
TrainSen	00010	 At least they encourage people to vote.
TrainSen	00010	 That's a positive message coming from a negative source.
TrainSen	00010	 I guess no one or nothing is truly evil.
TrainSen	00010	 Well, nine minutes gone.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm feeling stretched, like butter spread over too much bread, as Bilbo put it.
TrainSen	00010	 Like everything in my mind has already come out and I'm squeezing a juicebox trying to suck the dregs of thought through that straw.
TrainSen	00010	 Of course, with a juicebox you can never quite get out all the liquid, and I suppose it's the same with the mind.
TrainSen	00010	 One thing I never understood about the mind is how one gets from neurons firing and connecting with each other to actual consciousness.
TrainSen	00010	 In the textbook it seems like a step is skipped.
TrainSen	00010	 An analogy can be made (and has been, I assume) between the mind and the computer.
TrainSen	00010	 One could say, well, magnetic information doesn't seem at first glance to represent data and images and text.
TrainSen	00010	 But the former is converted into the latter by programs, which themselves run on magnetic data.
TrainSen	00010	 Where are the programs in the mind?  It's hard to believe that the human mind just coincidentally has the neurons in all the right patterns to be able to form speech and thought and movement.
TrainSen	00010	 Where is the software?  I'm just rambling now.
TrainSen	00010	 Although that's the purpose of this paper, isn't it?  Ha ha.
TrainSen	00010	 I tried to read the book House of Leaves, I was told it was brilliant, but you know what?  It, for lack of a better and more descriptive and more culturally acceptable word, sucks.
TrainSen	00010	 It's written in a nonfiction style, but the endless footnotes serve only to distract from character development and this won't make much sense to whoever is reading this if they haven't read it.
TrainSen	00010	 Speaking of which, Hello, whoever is reading this!  I hope you're having a wonderful day.
TrainSen	00010	 Although reading hundreds of stream of consciousness papers is not my idea of a wonderful day.
TrainSen	00010	 Still, someone's got to do it, right?  Someone's got to do all the dirty jobs in the world, until they design an automated way to do it.
TrainSen	00010	 Then the worker loses their job.
TrainSen	00010	 Which is better, I wonder-- working at a terrible job, or being replaced from that terrible job and not working at all?  Some day, hopefully, we will have robots to do all our terrible jobs for us.
TrainSen	00010	 We will become like Asimov's Solaria - thousands of robots to maintain a small human population.
TrainSen	00010	 Eventually it will go to extremes -- millions of robots to one human.
TrainSen	00010	 Or maybe not.
TrainSen	00010	 What will be the point of civilization then?  What is the point of it now?  To keep people happy?  Great job so far, I must say.
TrainSen	00010	 Nowadays people think that what they need to be happy is chemicals.
TrainSen	00010	 More and more chemicals, pills, etc.
TrainSen	00010	 to cure the imbalances in their head.
TrainSen	00010	 They should take a cue from computer repair people -- the problem is just as often in the software as in the hardware!  Biological psychology will go a great deal in explaining human behavior, but it can only go so far.
TrainSen	00010	 People who have no imbalance in their minds but still do terrible things or get depressed - what do we do with them?  Eighteen minutes, fifteen seconds have passed.
TrainSen	00010	 Quite a while to be writing.
TrainSen	00010	 You know, a second never seems so long as when you want it to be short.
TrainSen	00010	 I love time's relativity, even though this isn't really an application of it.
TrainSen	00010	 If only there was a way to have time speed up or slow down if we wanted it to -- now there would be a best-selling invention.
TrainSen	00010	 It all deals with people's perception anyway -- I bet there is a way, somewhere.
TrainSen	00010	 Although messing with brains like that probably isn't a good idea.
TrainSen	00010	 Speaking of good ideas, my time is just about up.
TrainSen	00010	 It's been a pleasure.
TrainSen	01000	Right now I am in my room trying to study.
TrainSen	01000	 I really don't know how to study at all.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm way behind in all my reading cause it's so boring.
TrainSen	01000	 Micah is printing something right now.
TrainSen	01000	 I am so bored.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to go home tomorrow, but I'm not done with my reading so I really can't do anything until I'm done with that.
TrainSen	01000	 Plus I don't know whose going to pick me up if I could go home.
TrainSen	01000	 Homer said he was going to find a way to come and get me, but I don't know if it's possible.
TrainSen	01000	 They said there is this race they are going to on Sunday and I really would like to go.
TrainSen	01000	 Gosh this seem to be forever to type.
TrainSen	01000	 I really miss my mom, but when I'm around she's always yelling at me.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't enjoy my time with her.
TrainSen	01000	 Every time we get into an agrument I feel bad afterwards cause I know she might not be around for very long.
TrainSen	01000	 I love her so  much I just wish we can hang out and do what other family does and be happy.
TrainSen	01000	 My sister is not talking to her right now because of what happen last week and I wish it never did happen.
TrainSen	01000	 I would be aleast happier to talk to her everyday.
TrainSen	01000	 She seem to always cry when I do talk to her.
TrainSen	01000	 My life seem to suck comparing to all the other people.
TrainSen	01000	 Micah is standing here right now watching me type.
TrainSen	01000	 Right now I'm looking around room.
TrainSen	01000	 My roommate is making me nervous, she was looking at me type.
TrainSen	01000	 I think we need to start cleaning our room cause we have books and stuff everywhere.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss Juan, he went back to califorina for the Marines and he has not called me since the last time.
TrainSen	01000	 It's been like a week.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been feeling a little dumb around UT cause everyone seem to be so smart.
TrainSen	01000	 Even my friend Sarah feel this way.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe I just don't belong here with all the smart people.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm a poor person, and it just make it worst to see that most of the people that goes here are rich.
TrainSen	01000	 They talked about how they are going to get a piece of land and build their house and have lots and lots of parties.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know if I can even afford a house right now.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom lives in an apartment and she barely make enough to pay for all the bills.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like I'm using all her money going here.
TrainSen	01000	 I love her so much.
TrainSen	01000	 She's always been here for me even if we get in fights.
TrainSen	01000	 My life would have been better if I have my dad around.
TrainSen	01000	 He doesn't even seem  to care if I'm alive or not.
TrainSen	01000	 He never sent us anything.
TrainSen	01000	 The only thing that I get from him is a child support paycheck, which I don't really care for.
TrainSen	01000	 I need money, but it always come  and go.
TrainSen	01000	 And it sure doesn't make me happy.
TrainSen	01000	 Homer really likes me but I don't know him enough to go out with him.
TrainSen	01000	 Is that bad?  For some reason I still like Isrel, but he's just the type of person that want girls for sex.
TrainSen	01000	 He wanted to take me home this one day, but I said no.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't like people looking at me like I am a hoe, because I know I'm not a hoe.
TrainSen	01000	 My mind is blank right now.
TrainSen	01000	 To me life just seem to suck.
TrainSen	01000	 Isrel seem to be a non commitment person, and I wish he was because I would like to go out with him and be with him.
TrainSen	01000	  I guess I just like the idea that   I like him and if we get together and get marry someday he would be able to support me and make me happy.
TrainSen	01000	 My goal right now is to  do good in school and build a great career for myself and prove to my friend's that I can graduate from UT if I try my best.
TrainSen	01000	 They keep on telling my that I'm wasting my money going to UT because it's much cheaper when I go at home.
TrainSen	01000	 I just always wanted to go to UT and here I am  following my dreams.
TrainSen	01000	  I'm trying to find a job right now but it seem so hard.
TrainSen	01000	 So many people are searching for jobs and I'm out of luck.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I might switch my bank to bank one because they have free checking account and the one I have with bank of america isn't free.
TrainSen	01000	 After this I need to start reading  all of my books I wonder how far I'm going to get before I decide to go do something again.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm almost done I have less then a minute now.
TrainSen	01000	 I really enjoy my psychology class.
TrainSen	01000	 It's one of the best class I have here at UT so far.
TrainSen	01000	 I just hope I'll do good.
TrainSen	01000	 My goal is to do good and get into the nursing major.
TrainSen	00100	    Sleep! That's what I need to do.
TrainSen	00100	 I stayed up all night writing my freshman seminar paper on Bond- Born an electric quartet.
TrainSen	00100	 I asked my roommate that I was going to get some shut eye for about 10 minutes and to wake me up for my class at ten, but she woke me up 40 minutes later.
TrainSen	00100	 I wasn't late.
TrainSen	00100	 Thank GOD! I'm really stressed out, I have so many things to do this weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 Why is college so easy yet so hard to manage.
TrainSen	00100	 Management, I believe, is the biggest thing in college.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss my family so much.
TrainSen	00100	 I really don't know if I'm doing this right.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm trying to type so fast that my hands are shaking and I'm pressing the wrong keys.
TrainSen	00100	 Grrr! My roommate is leaving today to see her family.
TrainSen	00100	 Good for her.
TrainSen	00100	 We were both crying, actually I was the only one come to think of it.
TrainSen	00100	 She said she never cries even if it is the saddest thing ever.
TrainSen	00100	 How can you not cry.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess I'm very emotional and sensitive.
TrainSen	00100	 I was sick last weekend and when my parents came up to see me they were really worried.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope they are healthy and son't worry so much.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to see them and my brothers so bad.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm done with classes and I'm free!! I love the feeling of writing in streams of consciousness.
TrainSen	00100	 It is probably one of my favorite past times besides playing and composing music.
TrainSen	00100	 I really want to be super good on my electric violin.
TrainSen	00100	 After writing my paper about the electric quartet, I realized that I wanted to be like them.
TrainSen	00100	 I actually miss my quartet.
TrainSen	00100	 They all went to the University of Chicago and are sophomores there.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm always the youngest in everything.
TrainSen	00100	 youngest in my graduating class, among my friens, at my church-- that is youth bible group, and even among the freshmans here at UT.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel so old yet so young compared to others here.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't believe that there are 30 maybe even 40 year olds in my calculus class.
TrainSen	00100	 I was so shocked when several older males came and sat in our lecture.
TrainSen	00100	 They are older than my professor and TA's.
TrainSen	00100	 What are they doing here at such a old age, I wonder.
TrainSen	00100	 Did they flunk, not graduate, drop out and then realize many years later that school is the best place to be! I was walking out of PCL after studying late and this homeless guy walks up and asked for money.
TrainSen	00100	 I ignored him because I was creeped out.
TrainSen	00100	 It is my belief that if a homeless is not missing any limbs and is perfectly capable to work then he/she should.
TrainSen	00100	 However, if they are missing an arm or let's say play the saxophone on the street, I would definetly give them some change.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel that they are doing their best with the disabilities facing them.
TrainSen	00100	 Last night, my roommate came in with her best guy friend, who's bi-sexual, and another guy that I later found was gay.
TrainSen	00100	 I really don't mind gay guys although I find it sad, I DO MIND if they are lesbians!! YUCK! I'm a strong christian girl so it really is hard for me to cope with such things.
TrainSen	00100	 I am very conservative and tend to not change my views for anyone unless the provide convincing evidence.
TrainSen	00100	 I really want to keep writing on and on but I have 2 minutes left.
TrainSen	00100	 I love to write especially poems.
TrainSen	00100	 I like being creative and connecting with my inner feelings.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess it is because I play classical music and only listen to classical music.
TrainSen	00100	 Classical music, I think is the most sensuous, expressive and beautiful form of art every created.
TrainSen	00100	 I would love to whip out my violin or go to a grand piano and play songs after songs.
TrainSen	00100	 I better wrap up--oh no--it's almost time for me to go.
TrainSen	00100	 I'll---phew--the computer is letting me write a little more.
TrainSen	00100	 Whoever is grading this is really going to enjoy reading everyone's writing.
TrainSen	00100	 Well, I got to head off to my Biology study group.
TrainSen	01000	I didn't sleep at all last night and I'm barely making it through my day.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel like a zombie, but hey what's new?  I have an english paper due on Monday.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I completely bombed the thesis.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess I can always go back and change it.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm tired, I can't think.
TrainSen	01000	 that's a lie, of course I can.
TrainSen	01000	 it will simply be rambling nonsensical jumble.
TrainSen	01000	 and that counts too right? sure it does.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been seeing this guy.
TrainSen	01000	 he's about seven years older than I am, and that shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it's more of an age difference than anyone I've dated before.
TrainSen	01000	 I can meet him on an itellectual level, conversation isn't lacking, there's physical attraction and the whole deal.
TrainSen	01000	 so why am I so doubtful? I suppose because I'm paranoid about becoming an obnoxious needy stereotypical girl.
TrainSen	01000	 Unfortunately I have been that to others in the past and refuse to ever play that part again.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm so much stronger now, more confident and comfortable with myself as a person.
TrainSen	01000	 Anyway, my point is I'm scared to let him know I'm sincerely intersted because I think it will freak him out and send him running in the other direction.
TrainSen	01000	 I can make my intentions known without actually verbalizing my feelings.
TrainSen	01000	 And I'm pretty sure at this time in the relationship- whatever time it might be- is too soon to bring up any of those concerns.
TrainSen	01000	 Is he seeing anyone else? Does he care? Does he not want to hurt my feelings so he won't tell me he doesn't want to hang out? it's so ridiculous to hear myself think like this.
TrainSen	01000	 basically I'm so afraid of rejection that I'm willing to do it myself, before anyone really gets the chance.
TrainSen	01000	 I've dated a plethera of losers over the past year and I'm tired of not caring about anyone.
TrainSen	01000	 anyone in that way I guess.
TrainSen	01000	 yes I have friends and have plenty to do without a guy to entertain (that sounds really harsh- it is me that wants this.
TrainSen	01000	 )but I miss that connection.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to be in love again.
TrainSen	01000	 but who doesn't? I suppose once I stop wanting it I'll find it.
TrainSen	01000	 that's the way of the world sometimes.
TrainSen	01000	 yeah but about him.
TrainSen	01000	 it is what it is and if it doesn't work out than so be it.
TrainSen	01000	 plenty of fish in the sea and all that.
TrainSen	01000	 but he does have some potential.
TrainSen	01000	 enough of this.
TrainSen	01000	 it's making my head hurt.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't like that my stream of consciousness has turned into more of a ""dear diary"" than anything else.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm sitting in the student microcomputer facility among my fellow longhorns at the moment.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder how many of them are doing this assignment right now.
TrainSen	01000	 maybe none.
TrainSen	01000	 everyone's in their own little worlds.
TrainSen	01000	 deep inside their thoughts or their research.
TrainSen	01000	 everyone seems so disconnectced, though I suppose that's the point of this place.
TrainSen	01000	 a quiet area to get work done, not social hour.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm about to go to ecology evolution and society.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been reading the assigned chapters, but I fear that I'm not actually retaining any of the information.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess it will become quite apparent when I get my first test scores back.
TrainSen	01000	 all I want to do here is to do well.
TrainSen	01000	 it's the only reason I'm living in austin again, to continue my education.
TrainSen	01000	 so that's what I aim to do.
TrainSen	01000	 make the most out of the billion things I have to accomplish today.
TrainSen	01000	 cross them off my list and get them out of the way in order to make room for all the new.
TrainSen	01000	 life is pretty enjoyable when you don't let it drag you down with the minor negative aspects.
TrainSen	01000	 so many people do that.
TrainSen	01000	 drown in their own self pity and reamin miserable regardless.
TrainSen	01000	 just smile sometimes, it really can make you feel better, and probably someone else as well.
TrainSen	01000	 that's what I think, but this mind of mine is all over the place and never seems to rest.
TrainSen	01000	 the end.
TrainSen	01000	 my time is up.
TrainSen	10000	     Hello looks like a journal entry.
TrainSen	10000	 Frustrating blank page as usual, not nearly as much  pressure as a true journal might be.
TrainSen	10000	 No, true journals (at least the ones I know) come complete  with the most irrational, egotistical, subjective criticisms at all.
TrainSen	10000	 Here, I might simply start to list  adjectives.
TrainSen	10000	 Think I will.
TrainSen	10000	 Chair, run, cake, spoon, sparrow, harly, make, spy, insult, laughter,  organization, economy, ----- complete crap!!! Ha! Adjectives are fun.
TrainSen	10000	 What to make of this  phenomenal opportunity?  Don't be shy, be compliant.
TrainSen	10000	 Or just spew forth venom, anecdotes,  general life lessons.
TrainSen	10000	 Inclination says talk about ""me"".
TrainSen	10000	 Here's what that is.
TrainSen	10000	 Or so we'll try.
TrainSen	10000	 Music, menus, frustration.
TrainSen	10000	 Solitary, isolated, friendship social butterfly.
TrainSen	10000	 Making waves the size  of anthills, feeling pretty depressed about it.
TrainSen	10000	 The color of the water is green.
TrainSen	10000	 Count the levels  of meaning there.
TrainSen	10000	 Anaphor.
TrainSen	10000	 Hyperbole.
TrainSen	10000	 Homonyms.
TrainSen	10000	 Czech Republic.
TrainSen	10000	 Czeska Republica.
TrainSen	10000	 The  United States of my Ass.
TrainSen	10000	 Could I say here that I want to ______ the president?  Protect Identity.
TrainSen	10000	 The blank might have been filled with ""make love"" or ""marry"" or ""help through important  issues"".
TrainSen	10000	 Certainly not ""castrate.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  What else?  Looking forward to making A's lots of A's, because  after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and  ass kissing.
TrainSen	10000	 Discombobulated this page may be, but organization's overrated.
TrainSen	10000	 I know a quote:  one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  That  one's right above Dad's desk at the office.
TrainSen	10000	 Why do I experience comfort in an environment less  than rational? or organized?  Possibly the same reason I love psychoactive mindbenders (by this,  of course, I refer to puzzles and games like scrabble!) Because true beauty in life exposes itself  not in the routine, as religious dogma might promise, but at an Indian buffet at which one can  stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures, waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a  Western mind for validation.
TrainSen	10000	 what else?  I think this weekend I'm going to stimulate myself with  something organic - or possibly inorganic - and clean up the house.
TrainSen	10000	 Make normal people  sense of the place so that when Mom and Dad show up tomorrow they don't swallow their  tongues.
TrainSen	10000	 Music makes everything voluptuous, adds another layer to experiences so that they  find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively.
TrainSen	10000	 Takeover from an armchair.
TrainSen	10000	 Natural delicacies.
TrainSen	10000	 TV numbs, music accentuates, pleasure reading enriches, highest level math  and science is God.
TrainSen	10000	 School puts the kind of pressure on people that creates Ted Bundies.
TrainSen	10000	 UT is  anything but a good school, just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a  good idea.
TrainSen	10000	 Just going doesn't plant seeds of positivity or success.
TrainSen	10000	 I was the fool, caught in the  wave of college matriculation, and still to this day I feel I need four more years.
TrainSen	10000	 Just like that  fucking idiot GW Bush.
TrainSen	10000	 Right now, and not because I endorse the use of any of the following  terms, I'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that I  rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when I open the floodgates.
TrainSen	10000	 It's because I  wanted to call Bush a faggot, or a fucking idiot, or a fucking shithead hyppocrite, but some  mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red  hand before any other utterance could follow.
TrainSen	10000	 Well, here, you fuck, stop this!!!!  Oh, I was going  to go into some racial slurs, but that's just so stupid.
TrainSen	10000	 How about cracker-ass whitebread honky  guerro americano puto!  that would be perfect for me.
TrainSen	10000	 Still, something about WASPy racial slurs  isn't nearly as intimidating as ""nigger"" or ""spic"" or daggerhead, or whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 This world exists  as a cesspool of religious dogma, hate, and a need to evolve.
TrainSen	10000	 It's going to suck till that evolution  takes place, but God Damn it, I'll wallow in the shit till I die and I'll like it.
TrainSen	10000	 Couldn't qualify, for  that reason, as the typical ""good people"" one might imagine a large percentage of those floating  around Earth for some god or cause might hope.
TrainSen	10000	 That's what makes music --- done.
TrainSen	00001	     Ok, I'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since I've been told I type rather fast the professor to teacher's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of Mark's mind.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope that no one reads this seriously at all.
TrainSen	00001	 Ok now someone is watching me type, oh they're gone.
TrainSen	00001	 That was fast, I'm telling you this is a waste of time and I'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss my wife.
TrainSen	00001	 Yeah that's right my wife.
TrainSen	00001	 We aren't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and I do.
TrainSen	00001	 I certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because I actually do take it very seriously.
TrainSen	00001	 I love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I'll write about pizza hut.
TrainSen	00001	 They got this buffet that's only 3.
TrainSen	00001	 99, not bad, but the same as cici's so if they're pizza is not far superior than I will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal.
TrainSen	00001	 I know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and I will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children I will do whatever I can to ensure this.
TrainSen	00001	 I love my wife so much.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss her terribly.
TrainSen	00001	 There seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how I have many a time disputed the reality of free will.
TrainSen	00001	 How can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally.
TrainSen	00001	 Because if I had full free will I could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that I would be judged for my actions on earth.
TrainSen	00001	 But since I couldn't choose whether or not I could be exposed to such information.
TrainSen	00001	 I am a Catholic.
TrainSen	00001	 This is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person.
TrainSen	00001	 But the truth is that I consider myself a part of this religion yet I do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion.
TrainSen	00001	 For example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me.
TrainSen	00001	 My idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this:  Good people go to heaven.
TrainSen	00001	 Bad people go to hell.
TrainSen	00001	 Simple right?  Except what I qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good.
TrainSen	00001	 So what now?  Is my idea of good right or is theirs.
TrainSen	00001	 But wait, the plot thickens.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem.
TrainSen	00001	 You see I believe that God instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good.
TrainSen	00001	 The most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something I find to be unacceptable I can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable.
TrainSen	00001	 I am almost always right in this aspect.
TrainSen	00001	 Every time I have seen something I think is wrong I can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong.
TrainSen	00001	 However, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions.
TrainSen	00001	 The hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions.
TrainSen	00001	 I am not proud of all that I've done in my life.
TrainSen	00001	 The only reason I can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because I apply this theory to myself and find it to be true.
TrainSen	00001	 I once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends.
TrainSen	00001	 One of the worst days of my life.
TrainSen	00001	 There is no reason I can use to explain my actions.
TrainSen	00001	 But I did it to end the relationship.
TrainSen	00001	 Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
TrainSen	00001	 Good job huh?  Well she didn't want to leave anyway.
TrainSen	00001	 At least that was what I thought.
TrainSen	00001	 I was so damn confused.
TrainSen	00001	 I cheated on her, a rule I set for myself a long time ago was that I would NEVER cheat on a girlfriend.
TrainSen	00001	 And I did.
TrainSen	00001	 I disgraced myself and I hate.
TrainSen	00001	 Er hated myself for it.
TrainSen	00001	 I did it to invoke another of my rules for myself.
TrainSen	00001	 Should an infraction upon the rule about NEVER cheating on my girlfriend I must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know if I'm wrong.
TrainSen	00001	 But I could be.
TrainSen	00001	 Man you know sometimes music can just totally change one's mood.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I'm listening to Damien Rice.
TrainSen	00001	 The little known writer of some of the best music I've ever heard.
TrainSen	00001	 I think he's great.
TrainSen	00001	 It's kind of weird I guess for a guy to like some other guy's music so much but I do.
TrainSen	00001	 I also like this guy Joseph Arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me.
TrainSen	00001	 Their style of singing their lyrics are all so real.
TrainSen	00001	 I love the way I can relate to it.
TrainSen	00001	 I recently read ""A streetcar named desire"".
TrainSen	00001	 The female role of blanche.
TrainSen	00001	 She is like my ex.
TrainSen	00001	 She lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they ""want""  NEVER tell me what I want.
TrainSen	00001	 Only I know that and I don't appreciate being told.
TrainSen	00001	 If anyone ever makes assumptions about who I am before I meet them.
TrainSen	00001	 I get reasonably angry but I hide it pretty ok.
TrainSen	00001	 You.
TrainSen	00001	 For some reason I have been descrimanated against for being Mexican twice in my life.
TrainSen	00001	 Both times by a girlfriends family.
TrainSen	00001	 I have an extraordinarily pale complexion.
TrainSen	00001	 The funny thing about that is one of them is Mexican.
TrainSen	00001	 Heh what can I say.
TrainSen	01000	Well, I'm not exactly sure what to write about.
TrainSen	01000	 I just finished my prescreening for the Psychology Experiment stuff and I now have to 1.
TrainSen	01000	 5 credits for it.
TrainSen	01000	 So I only have to get 3.
TrainSen	01000	 5 more I guess to get the 5.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope the experiment things aren't anything to bad and they don't take that long.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate typing when I have rings and bracelets on.
TrainSen	01000	 I really like to wear jewelry but they just start to hurt me when they rub up against the keyboard holder thingy.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know how I'm going to be able to write straight for 20 minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 I just took my bracelet off, it was really hurting.
TrainSen	01000	 I have so much homework to do this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess teachers (professors) think that since it's a long weekend we shoudl have time to do all kinds of stuff so they give us more work.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess the professors don't realize that each teacher gives us more and we would like to have some free time too.
TrainSen	01000	 I also have to go to all kinds of places this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to go to Dallas to see my half sister because she's in the hospital for something, I really don't want to go though.
TrainSen	01000	 We never talk anymore and why should I go see her when she can't even call me when she promises to.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, I met these friends at UT.
TrainSen	01000	 They are so great.
TrainSen	01000	 One of them really.
TrainSen	01000	 Her name is Sarah and she's really nice.
TrainSen	01000	 I think we might try to get an apartment together next year so we can live together and not have to put up with stupid roommates like the one I have this year.
TrainSen	01000	 She lied to me about everything and I think she might be doing some kind of drugs or something.
TrainSen	01000	 The other day I heard her talking to some friends about sniffing some kind of chemicals in some guy's dorm.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know what they were talking about, that is just what I heard.
TrainSen	01000	 Carol is talking about Sarah right now to my dad while my mom is sleeping.
TrainSen	01000	 She thinks Sarah is so cool.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if what I eat is actually eating a lot or if I'm just eating a normal amount of food.
TrainSen	01000	 I try to eat 3 meals a day even though the food isn't always great.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, Kinsolving isn't all that great.
TrainSen	01000	 Some of the food is good, but I can't stand eating there every day.
TrainSen	01000	 They need to have food on this campus other than chicken.
TrainSen	01000	 I love chicken and I used to want it all the time, but now since I've been here I've been dying for beef.
TrainSen	01000	 The other day I was so stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 I was talking to Carol on the phone and I said, ""I'm tired, but I don't want to lay down.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm bored but I don't want to do anything.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not hungry, but I'm dying for meat.
TrainSen	01000	 ""  I bet I sounded so stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 I drove home today from Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 I really didn't want to becuase I haven't drove anywhere in like a month, but I really need to start driving again.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait till I get to go to Casa Ole again.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe Austin doesn't have them here.
TrainSen	01000	 That is like the stupidest thing in the world.
TrainSen	01000	 I take that back.
TrainSen	01000	 The stupidest thing in the world is that UT doesn't sell Dr.
TrainSen	01000	 Pepper anywhere!  How can they do that!  If you ask any person our age what soft drink they would prefer, the majority of them would say that they like Dr.
TrainSen	01000	 Pepper the best.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom just woke up.
TrainSen	01000	 I finally found one places on campus that has it though.
TrainSen	01000	 The Union has Dr.
TrainSen	01000	 Pepper at the Taco Bell.
TrainSen	01000	 I haven't checked anywhere else yet.
TrainSen	01000	 My dad is talking about this guy's truck that got stolen today.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't believe that happened.
TrainSen	01000	 They live in a pretty good part of town and nothing like that ever happens here.
TrainSen	01000	 My dogs are fighting.
TrainSen	01000	 I have two dogs, Milo and Brewser.
TrainSen	01000	 Milo is a red beagle that is Brewser's son and he turned a year old May 15, 2004.
TrainSen	01000	 Brewser is a black beagle that turns 11 on October 11, 2004.
TrainSen	01000	 It's weird to think of their age.
TrainSen	01000	 Milo is really crazy and Brewser is really calm.
TrainSen	01000	 It probably is because he is so old though.
TrainSen	01000	 I felt so stupid today in Biology.
TrainSen	01000	 We had to work in these small groups and figure out these questions the teacher told us to do and for the first question, I sort of knew the answer but I didn't have it completely right.
TrainSen	01000	 The second question was to figure out the hypothesis out of a group of statements but it was hard.
TrainSen	01000	 When I was in high school we were always told to write a hypothesis in ""If, Then"" form.
TrainSen	01000	 Meaning that this would be an example, ""IF we put this together, THEN this should happen.
TrainSen	01000	 ""  In this class though, its just a statement.
TrainSen	01000	 No ifs.
TrainSen	01000	 No thens.
TrainSen	01000	 No questions.
TrainSen	01000	 It just made me feel stupid cause I could pick the hypothesis out of the group.
TrainSen	01000	 There there was the last question that she asked and I had no clue about it.
TrainSen	01000	 All that really scared me though because I am afraid of not making it in Austin here at UT.
TrainSen	01000	 Out of my high school we had 106 seniors.
TrainSen	01000	 Out of those 106 there were 59 that went to college or went to some trade school or ARMY.
TrainSen	01000	 Out of those 59, 35 went to aTm.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't get over that.
TrainSen	01000	 Only 2 of us came to UT and that is me and my ex boyfriend, Nathan.
TrainSen	01000	 I am afraid of what all my aTm ""friends"" would say if I couldn't make it here.
TrainSen	01000	 I really don't know what to talk about.
TrainSen	01000	 I keep making all these stupid noises just because I can't think of what to say.
TrainSen	01000	 My sister is now watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire and my dad just ate some M&Ms.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom is out feeding Milo and Brewser.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, Milo is actually mine.
TrainSen	01000	 I was too young for Brewser to actually be mine so he is actually my mom and dad's.
TrainSen	01000	 Carol has a dog, ferret, and fish at her house in Temple.
TrainSen	01000	 The dog's name is Bart.
TrainSen	01000	 Carol is laughing at me because she is reading what I am writing and she thinks this is the stupidest assignment in the world.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to say, that since I've been writing it, I have to agree.
TrainSen	01000	 I think it's kind of cool, but I really don't see the point in having to write this all out.
TrainSen	01000	 Well, I understand that it is cool to see how the mind thinks and how our brain processes information, but this sort of seems like a waste of time.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, well.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm getting credit for it.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh, I might get to go to my first concert pretty soon.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm going to try to get to tickets to the Austin City Limits thing.
TrainSen	01000	 Sarah and Gabby were telling me about it and while I was in class today they tried to go get tickets.
TrainSen	01000	 Gabby got one but while Sarah was in line, they cut everybody off like 3 people in front of her.
TrainSen	00001	     Right now I am sitting here.
TrainSen	00001	 The washing machine is very loud.
TrainSen	00001	 My nose is  really stuffy.
TrainSen	00001	 I really like that band brandston that I saw the othernight.
TrainSen	00001	 they were  really nice and really cool.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait until I get to hang out with steven.
TrainSen	00001	 I really  missed him while I was in austin.
TrainSen	00001	 stupid nose itches.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't understand why randi  and I seem to not be as close anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 Its kind of sad.
TrainSen	00001	 She has been my best  friend for 5 years.
TrainSen	00001	 Its really ironic that steven is now my best friend.
TrainSen	00001	 who would  have ever thought? ""Don't come crying back to me.
TrainSen	00001	 When you're lonely and all out  of love"" is a song lyric from brandston that is going through my head constantly  causing me right now to basically only be able to think about that one specific  song.
TrainSen	00001	 Its a very nice song.
TrainSen	00001	 Very simple, yet it manages to me a very interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 I  can't believe that I still have 17 minutes left to type.
TrainSen	00001	 Its usually very hard for me to  type stream of consciousnes, I've tried it before in a humanities class for some  reason.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't ever seem to really put what I'm thinking on paper.
TrainSen	00001	 that's why its  hard for me to write or keep a journal.
TrainSen	00001	 I even lie to myself on paper.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder why.
TrainSen	00001	 I also wonder why Mikey is the way he is with me.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't believe I ran into him last  night.
TrainSen	00001	 He completely ignored me.
TrainSen	00001	 That really hurts my feelings because we were  really close.
TrainSen	00001	 At least I thought so.
TrainSen	00001	 I really need closure.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate myself for not  hating him.
TrainSen	00001	 My nose is running again now.
TrainSen	00001	 It's getting in the way of my typing.
TrainSen	00001	 I  am so stressed out right now about biology.
TrainSen	00001	 The house is completely silent right  now except for the washing machine.
TrainSen	00001	 The dorm is never this quiet.
TrainSen	00001	 I think maybe  that's why I like the dorm.
TrainSen	00001	 Because its loud.
TrainSen	00001	 Ow, I just hit my ear that I just pierced.
TrainSen	00001	 Its really sore.
TrainSen	00001	 The pain only lasts for a split second though.
TrainSen	00001	 Its not as hot here in  amarillo as it is in austin.
TrainSen	00001	 the weather here for labor day is perfect.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I will go  and walk my dogs.
TrainSen	00001	 I just sneezed again.
TrainSen	00001	 I am sick of sneezing.
TrainSen	00001	 Stupid allergies.
TrainSen	00001	 I  need to print my chemistry notes and my chemistry homework.
TrainSen	00001	 I also need to read  chapters 3 and 4 for psychology.
TrainSen	00001	 I am behind.
TrainSen	00001	 I am so worried about my  biology.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't understand it and because of that I am not focusing as hard on my  other classes.
TrainSen	00001	 However, government should be easy.
TrainSen	00001	 I've taken that class before.
TrainSen	00001	 Psychology is fun, but I really do not know what to expect on my tests.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know  how I will do in that class.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought chemistry was easy, but apparently it isn't easy  at all.
TrainSen	00001	 someone is getting ice from the refrigerator.
TrainSen	00001	 I can hear it.
TrainSen	00001	 wow, does my  mind really jump this much?  that's really interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I am sort of truly  typing in a stream of consciencous.
TrainSen	00001	 am I even spelling that right?  I usually can  spell.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel like everyone else at UT is smarter than I am.
TrainSen	00001	 I am not used to that.
TrainSen	00001	  I'm always the smartest.
TrainSen	00001	 No one here knows my reputation.
TrainSen	00001	 no one knows that I  am smart.
TrainSen	00001	 But maybe I'm not smart.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe I am just lucky.
TrainSen	00001	 My little puppy shinobi  isn't eating anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe its because of his shots he got yesterday.
TrainSen	00001	 I really  missed my dogs.
TrainSen	00001	 zeb was very loving yesterday when he saw me.
TrainSen	00001	 He licked me  all over.
TrainSen	00001	 I love dogs so much.
TrainSen	00001	 but its ironic because my dogs aren't normal and don't  show me the same amount of love dogs usually show people.
TrainSen	00001	 other dogs like me  more.
TrainSen	00001	 just my luck.
TrainSen	00001	 I had to explain what I am doing to my mom.
TrainSen	00001	 this is all  interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 the fan is on now.
TrainSen	00001	 my legs are cold.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I'm sick.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to listen to  my new cd again.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't believe that I got to talk to further seems forever and get  put on the guest list for another show of theirs.
TrainSen	00001	 too bad I didn't go.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't believe  mikey thought they were terrible when he saw them.
TrainSen	00001	 oh well, he is probably just  tying to be ""emo"" and all cool and is just saying that to be different and to fit in with  the people  that he holds up on a pedestool.
TrainSen	00001	 why did I ever date a guy like that?  and why am I still so attracted to such a stupid jerk?  I hate people like him.
TrainSen	00001	 why  has he changed?  my stomach is hurting now again.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't like being sick.
TrainSen	00001	 I need  paper in order to print.
TrainSen	00001	 and a USB cable.
TrainSen	00001	 I hate that my printer doesn't work in my  dorm.
TrainSen	00001	 I brought it for nothing.
TrainSen	00001	 I bought some new cartridge too.
TrainSen	00001	 its all a waste.
TrainSen	00001	 I  can't return it.
TrainSen	00001	 well for thanksgiving or something I will bring the printer home and  have my dad try to fix it.
TrainSen	00001	 being home doesn't feel like home really.
TrainSen	00001	 just feels like I'm  visiting.
TrainSen	00001	 which is really what I'm doing.
TrainSen	00001	 my nose is itching again, I think I am going  to sneeze again.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel like I've been typing for 2 hours.
TrainSen	00001	 someone just opened  something.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't hear my dogs anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what they are doing.
TrainSen	00001	 my  stomach is still hurting.
TrainSen	00001	 the air conditioner just turned on.
TrainSen	00001	 I heard it.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't usually  hear these things.
TrainSen	00001	 that's strange.
TrainSen	00001	 my eyes are drooping.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm tired.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't slept  well for a couple days.
TrainSen	00001	 Why does he hate me?  I really wish I would just be brave  and confront him.
TrainSen	00001	 I always say I'm going to, and I really think that I am going to, but  then I chicken out and if anything, I am extremely nice to him only to have him  ignore me.
TrainSen	00001	 further seems forever was so good the other night.
TrainSen	00001	 the energy  around me at the concert was so good.
TrainSen	00001	 I was up in front.
TrainSen	00001	 that was great.
TrainSen	00001	 the new  lead singer was great.
TrainSen	00001	 I need to go to more places like that in austin.
TrainSen	00001	 I just typed  that sentence with my eyes closed.
TrainSen	00001	 I am really falling asleep.
TrainSen	00001	 my parents are  talking.
TrainSen	00001	 I can hear them.
TrainSen	00001	 my dad is selling my car.
TrainSen	00001	 that makes me sad because I  really like my car.
TrainSen	00001	 Even though I am getting a better car.
TrainSen	00010	     I'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder.
TrainSen	00010	 Everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another.
TrainSen	00010	 I keep asking myself whether or not I'm am going to make it in my major.
TrainSen	00010	 My major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major.
TrainSen	00010	 My friends say they don't know what I got myself into, but I keep telling them I'll be fine to not worry about me.
TrainSen	00010	 When I say this I am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that I will be fine.
TrainSen	00010	 This library is all to silent I think I just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing.
TrainSen	00010	 While I'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not I am going to make an A on the chemistry exam on Tuesday.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel bombarded with chem and I don't know if I am going to be able to remember all three chapters.
TrainSen	00010	 My mind keeps telling me that I will be fine that I just have to get used to it.
TrainSen	00010	 High School was so much different than college in that you had to much time you didn't know what to do with it.
TrainSen	00010	 That hasnt been my problem lately the only problems I have had all are about having not enough time.
TrainSen	00010	 Every time I talk to my girlfriend back home, a senior in high school, I tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy.
TrainSen	00010	 I know older people had told me the same but I really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh yeah I am getting off topic but this library is just boring me.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel like they all grasp the ideas that I don't.
TrainSen	00010	 In high school I was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe that's just me overthinking.
TrainSen	00010	 I can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library.
TrainSen	00010	 It smells like a piece of chocolate.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe it is a candybar of some sort.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't really care because that smell kind of nauseates me.
TrainSen	00010	 I am not a real big fan chocolate but I do love chocolate ice cream.
TrainSen	00010	 Something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure.
TrainSen	00010	 Lately I have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away.
TrainSen	00010	 SHe is graduating a semester early from HS and is going to move to austin and attend ACC for the remainder of the year.
TrainSen	00010	 I offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents.
TrainSen	00010	 I hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass.
TrainSen	00010	 Her father moved from italy to america in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name.
TrainSen	00010	 The man now owns a 30 million dollar business that he started from nothing.
TrainSen	00010	 He now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal, not spaghetti out of the jar, for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day.
TrainSen	00010	 All she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things.
TrainSen	00010	 She is one of the most ungrateful people I have ever encountered in my whole entire life.
TrainSen	00010	 People who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but I see the real her everyday.
TrainSen	00001	     I just opened iTunes and chose to play Miles Davis's album called ""A Tribute to Jack Johnson"".
TrainSen	00001	 The first song ""Right Off"" begins with a strong groove.
TrainSen	00001	 this music first puts me into a pretty good mood.
TrainSen	00001	 It motivates me to want to go to the gym or something and get a little exercise.
TrainSen	00001	 Now the song is quieting down a little bit after a few bars and slowly building back up.
TrainSen	00001	 Larry Coryell is on guitar I believe, if not I'm pretty sure it's John McLaughlin.
TrainSen	00001	 Now Miles is playing.
TrainSen	00001	 gosh.
TrainSen	00001	 he's quite an impressive player.
TrainSen	00001	 He's not showing off by playing a note every second.
TrainSen	00001	 He takes it slow and builds up a good improvised melody.
TrainSen	00001	   .
TrainSen	00001	 and they're always good too.
TrainSen	00001	 I'd like to choose the songs to play before class starts sometime, to give people a chance to hear very respectable music that most kids nowdays seem to neglect upon hearing, because of a difference in style from the popular, well-advertised music of the 90's and 00's.
TrainSen	00001	 or otherwise some people aren't even given the chance to be exposed to it.
TrainSen	00001	 My roommate just came in the room.
TrainSen	00001	 Speak of the devil, eh?  Take him for example.
TrainSen	00001	 When I first met him and asked what he listened to, the first two things he said were ""Metallica and Linkin Park"".
TrainSen	00001	 both of which I am not biased against or hold negative regard towards.
TrainSen	00001	 Actually I find both bands to be quite interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 I was exposed to Metallica and that very broad genre back around the days of middle school, and definately listened to it quite extensively.
TrainSen	00001	 Side note:  it's getting hot and I'm turning on the fan.
TrainSen	00001	 Could this music and the pressure to write as fast as I can be causing my body to heat up?  That could be quite interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 Going back.
TrainSen	00001	 I find it weird, well not weird but sad basically, that people like my roommate haven't heard and don't seem to be immediately open to new musical tastes.
TrainSen	00001	 ""new"" meaning ""previously unknown"" as opposed to recently released.
TrainSen	00001	 The song just phased into an ambient sound while Miles is playing over it.
TrainSen	00001	 The drums, bass, and guitar have dropped out.
TrainSen	00001	 When the jam comes back in.
TrainSen	00001	 and here it comes.
TrainSen	00001	 oh yes.
TrainSen	00001	 Well done.
TrainSen	00001	 Movement (change) in music I have realized (as a good explanation) is what creates uniqueness and good sound.
TrainSen	00001	 Change can include any part of sound.
TrainSen	00001	 pitch, tempo, tambre, etc.
TrainSen	00001	 Now it's just the Bass and Miles.
TrainSen	00001	 On this album is Billy Cobham on drums, Herbie Hancock is on keyboards.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not sure who the bass player is off the top of my head.
TrainSen	00001	 My roommate is playing video games behind me.
TrainSen	00001	 I understand his addiction.
TrainSen	00001	 I used to play games all the time throughout middle and high school.
TrainSen	00001	 I went to an Arts high school for music and sadly games distracted me from studying music and my academics.
TrainSen	00001	 obviously I did well enough to get into UT, but sadly not well enough for my own standards, although I did not realize it at the time.
TrainSen	00001	 I quit playing games during my senior year in high school, picked up some other bad habits, but since moving to Austin for school things have changed nicely, and although I'm not completely comfortable with the status of my lifes general direction yet, I guess I feel slightly better and more able to concentrate on the future.
TrainSen	00001	 although the future is quite unexpected, otherwise I don't really know what I'm going to do.
TrainSen	00001	 The song just dropped into a drum jam with a guitar riff running continuously over it.
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 and time's up.
TrainSen	00100	     I am thinking about how to write this paper.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't think of what to write.
TrainSen	00100	 Jessica is putting papers in her notebook I am typing the ring around te logo is blue.
TrainSen	00100	 the ring around the logo is blue.
TrainSen	00100	 someone just entered I would rather be playing music.
TrainSen	00100	 Andrew says goodnight 1 minute 58 seconds.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm sort of hungry.
TrainSen	00100	 I think writing this makes me more hungry.
TrainSen	00100	 I have so much homework to do and other responsibilities.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish I had no responsibility at this point in time.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm worried about psychology because the content seems too easy to take a test on, suggesting I'm understanding the full realm of the content or the full realm of my responsibilities in this class although philosophy is worse.
TrainSen	00100	 I cannot imagine being tested over anything in that class.
TrainSen	00100	 Astronomy is just about the most difficult class I've ever taken because it's pure physics and not really learning about the general properties of celestial bodies.
TrainSen	00100	 I've got a block.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to write more songs, I haven't been able to write fully in over a year.
TrainSen	00100	 but I could never be nearly as good as the Pixies so it seems frivolous to even try.
TrainSen	00100	 water I'm beginning to drift off.
TrainSen	00100	 I really need to do my homework more often I have way too much.
TrainSen	00100	 I need a cellphone.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I'm the only person in Austin with no cell phone.
TrainSen	00100	 everyone assumes I have a cell phone.
TrainSen	00100	 I can't even get long distance jessica just stuck her finger in my mouth.
TrainSen	00100	 she didn't think I'd write that.
TrainSen	00100	 or that.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm almost halfway through.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm sleepy.
TrainSen	00100	 my girlfriend is sexy.
TrainSen	00100	 Andrew offered to be her tutor.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm running out of things to write about.
TrainSen	00100	 the Pixies are the best band ever.
TrainSen	00100	 bar none.
TrainSen	00100	 they incorporate obscure time signatures and lyrics into the most influential sound ever, the only quesionable exception being the Velvet Underground.
TrainSen	00100	 they were copied by many bands yet don't get credit for it.
TrainSen	00100	 listen to Weezer's ""The Sweater Song"" and the Pixies ""I Bleed"".
TrainSen	00100	 Weezer was even on their tribute CD.
TrainSen	00100	 No coincidence.
TrainSen	00100	 listen to any Nirvana song compared to any Pixies song.
TrainSen	00100	 Nirvana usually gets the credit for creating the modern alternative genre, but it was the Pixies.
TrainSen	00100	 the liars are pretty awesome too.
TrainSen	00100	 same with fugazi.
TrainSen	00100	 and the desaparecidos, even though bright eyes is conor oberst's creative offspring.
TrainSen	00100	 but the best up-and-coming band is the unicorns.
TrainSen	00100	 they're neat.
TrainSen	00100	 16 43.
TrainSen	00100	 it's already nearly 12 o'clock.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't want to go back to my room because my roommate is boring and I'll miss Jessica.
TrainSen	00100	 and he'll want to go sleep when I come in, like he was waiting up for me.
TrainSen	00100	 this is hurting my wrists.
TrainSen	00100	 Party on the Plaza was a little dull.
TrainSen	00100	     I love the movie Dirty Dancing.
TrainSen	00100	 it is just a great movie.
TrainSen	00100	 got to love patrick swayze.
TrainSen	00100	 I got the crest white strips for my birthday.
TrainSen	00100	 (not sure if it is an insult yet.
TrainSen	00100	 Hehe)and they are pretty great.
TrainSen	00100	 kind of make my teeth sore.
TrainSen	00100	 But there is a price to pay for beauty.
TrainSen	00100	 speaking of beauty.
TrainSen	00100	 I burned my face! that makes me laugh.
TrainSen	00100	 I was trying to use a curling iron, and got my fae instead.
TrainSen	00100	 yep.
TrainSen	00100	 What better than a burnt face?wow.
TrainSen	00100	 Only 3 minutes have passed.
TrainSen	00100	 Insane.
TrainSen	00100	 I fell asleep at 7 in the morning yesterday because I am neurortic(or however you spell it).
TrainSen	00100	 see.
TrainSen	00100	 Over the summer I began watching queer as folk, and only got to the beginning of the second season, and at the moment, the show is in it's fourth.
TrainSen	00100	 so.
TrainSen	00100	 Having the luxury of high speed internet, I went to the website and caught up on the 40 episodes I have missed.
TrainSen	00100	 and for every episode there were two video clips.
TrainSen	00100	 And needless to say, I watched them all.
TrainSen	00100	 it was amazing to see whathappened with the characters.
TrainSen	00100	 they changed so much.
TrainSen	00100	 I kind of hate watching shows because I get so attached to the characters.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel they have an obligation to me to do the ""right"" thing.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe that is why I am addicted to the young and the restless.
TrainSen	00100	 I have been watching this soap opera since I was 6.
TrainSen	00100	 Not Playing.
TrainSen	00100	 kind of like a family tradition.
TrainSen	00100	 my mom passed the torch on to me, and to this day I still record the show! I can't get enough of it.
TrainSen	00100	 My brother tells me I am neurotic all the time.
TrainSen	00100	 so I have a funny way of doing things sometimes.
TrainSen	00100	 Doesn't everybody?.
TrainSen	00100	 I like to eat the skins of pickles but only dill pickles.
TrainSen	00100	 And I don't like to eat the seeds or membranes of a jalapeno.
TrainSen	00100	 So what!.
TrainSen	00100	 He makes me laugh.
TrainSen	00100	 wow.
TrainSen	00100	 Only ten minutes so far.
TrainSen	00100	 Twenty minutes is a long ass time when you think about it.
TrainSen	00100	 But not when you are watching a show.
TrainSen	00100	 my mind goes to michael now.
TrainSen	00100	 The ""man"" of my dreams.
TrainSen	00100	 known him since sixth grade and never really got oever him.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I think about him out of habit now.
TrainSen	00100	 Who knows.
TrainSen	00100	 He got me a dirty dancing poster for my birthday.
TrainSen	00100	 That was incredibly sweet.
TrainSen	00100	 my birthday activities revolved around dirty dancing.
TrainSen	00100	 went to see the mr.
TrainSen	00100	 Sinus people make fun of the move I love dearly.
TrainSen	00100	 it was damn funny I'd have to admit.
TrainSen	00100	 patrick swayze is fantastic.
TrainSen	00100	 I would marry him right this minute.
TrainSen	00100	 Well maybe not.
TrainSen	00100	 I would marry ""johnny"" right this minute.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel lonely.
TrainSen	00100	 Never had a boyfriend.
TrainSen	00100	 I know why.
TrainSen	00100	 But we won't get into that just yet.
TrainSen	00100	 probably never.
TrainSen	00100	 I just want someone to think I am special.
TrainSen	00100	 Someone to think I am cute.
TrainSen	00100	 someone who will go out of their way to see me or just someone who really understands me.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow.
TrainSen	00100	 kind of makes me want to cry.
TrainSen	00100	 I am a big brave dog.
TrainSen	00100	 hehe.
TrainSen	00100	 just a phrase me and my best friend use when we feel a little weak.
TrainSen	00100	 the older I get the more I think about these things.
TrainSen	00100	 wanting a companion.
TrainSen	00100	 wanting a boyfriend.
TrainSen	00100	 makes me feel unusual not having one.
TrainSen	00100	 Never having one.
TrainSen	00100	 but who knows.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe I will meet the man of my dreams tomorrow.
TrainSen	00100	 Highly doubt it.
TrainSen	00100	 But anywho.
TrainSen	00100	 I find that now that I have less time.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to get more out.
TrainSen	00100	 This is very helpful.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if I am pretty.
TrainSen	00100	 From time to time I think I am, but then I see myself on an off day and realize why I have never had a boyfriend.
TrainSen	00100	 I like john ritter.
TrainSen	00100	 Love jack from three's company.
TrainSen	00100	 would marry him in a heartbeat.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe my standards are too high.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 I know why .
TrainSen	00100	 But that is another story.
TrainSen	00100	 can't believe all this just came pouring out of me.
TrainSen	00100	 Strange.
TrainSen	00100	 I thought this would be difficult.
TrainSen	00100	 I like this.
TrainSen	00100	 A lot.
TrainSen	00100	 I love the dirty dancing soundtrack.
TrainSen	00100	 What a wonderful movie! there is none better.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe Hedwig and the angry inch.
TrainSen	00100	 But dirty dancing will always come first.
TrainSen	00100	 patrick swayze was my first love.
TrainSen	00100	 if you can call it that.
TrainSen	00100	 first one who mademe cry.
TrainSen	10000	Today was a long day.
TrainSen	10000	 I have been going none stop on about four hours of sleep.
TrainSen	10000	 Chemistry 301, I have found, is really kicking my butt.
TrainSen	10000	 I made a seventy on the quiz, but I think I could have done a lot better.
TrainSen	10000	 Tonight I'm going to go see Shrek 2 with Andres and the guys.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't remember if it is any good or not, but I guess I'm going as an excuse not to do my homework.
TrainSen	10000	 One day I will get around to reading chapter three in psychology.
TrainSen	10000	 This weekend I'm taking Bethany to Oklahoma to go see Bradley and Jon for Brad's birthday party.
TrainSen	10000	 Oklahoma City is such a far drive from here.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that it will take me about seven hours to get there but then I have to drive another thirty or so minutes to Edmund for the actual party.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm going to meet Mom Sunday afternoon on the way home for a nice home cooked meal.
TrainSen	10000	 I haven't had one of those for so long.
TrainSen	10000	 Well, actually Tim's mother cooked us fajitas and lasagne last weekend when we went to Mexico, but that is not the same as my mom's cooking.
TrainSen	10000	 After the UNT vs.
TrainSen	10000	 UT game on Saturday, which might I add we kicked their butt, about eight of us loaded up and decided to go to Mexico spur of the moment.
TrainSen	10000	 Tim's parents have a house in Laredo.
TrainSen	10000	 His dad works for A&M International University as an athletic director.
TrainSen	10000	 Hmmm.
TrainSen	10000	 I am running out of things to talk about now.
TrainSen	10000	 October 8th, is the Aubrey homecoming football game and my friend Niki has to crown this year's queen so I'm going home for the weekend to see everyone.
TrainSen	10000	 I miss everyone a lot but I don't as much as I thought that I would.
TrainSen	10000	 High school was great but college is so much better.
TrainSen	10000	 Although, I would have to say that even though I was the valedictorian and I didn't have to study that much in high school, college is so much more difficult.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I'll probably change my major a few times too.
TrainSen	10000	 I know for sure that I want to do something in the medical field with children but I have no idea what I want to major in before I get there.
TrainSen	10000	 And would my phone quit freaking beeping at me so I can finish this assignment!  Ok its just Andres wanting to know if I am going to watch Shrek 2 at Jester tonight at 8.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish that I could have went to party on the plaza today but I had so much to do it was nearly impossible.
TrainSen	10000	 I had a TIP mentor meeting at 5, which is when my last class ended but I had to cut that an hour in a half short to go to a TIP seminar that was about notetaking.
TrainSen	10000	 Now how boring is taking notes about notetaking.
TrainSen	10000	 That is almost as bad as the seminar I have to go to three times a week.
TrainSen	10000	 Critical thinking is thinking about thinking.
TrainSen	10000	 YUCK!  Couldn't the writers of the book think of something just a little more creative than that.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean who wants to sit in lecture first thing in the morning and listen to a speech about what it means to be a critical thinker.
TrainSen	10000	 Anyways, then I left the notetaking seminar early to go to Women in Medicine.
TrainSen	10000	 The speaker there talked about how she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired.
TrainSen	10000	 I couldn't imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see.
TrainSen	10000	 I have 20/20 vision right now but that doesn't mean that I'm a good driver.
TrainSen	10000	 I have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks.
TrainSen	10000	 Two weeks ago I went to Dallas to go see my friends in a band and I ended up staying in Waxahachie until 8 in the morning.
TrainSen	10000	 When I was coming home the next day I stopped and got coffee before I headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later I dozed off.
TrainSen	10000	 I had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't believe I keep doing that.
TrainSen	10000	 It is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree.
TrainSen	10000	 My Dad called this weekend, which is odd considering he just decided to flee last Christmas and not tell anyone where he was going.
TrainSen	10000	 He said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure I was ok.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream.
TrainSen	10000	 The reason why I wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird.
TrainSen	10000	 If he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too?  Maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 just kidding.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok well here is the countdown.
TrainSen	10000	 I only have about 30 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok my time should be about up now.
TrainSen	10000	 Yeah ok I'm done.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	01000	     So I'm glad that this assignment is like this beacuse I love journaling and writing my thoughts down.
TrainSen	01000	 I must have had the most unluck day ever today, and now my mom is mad at me! That sucks.
TrainSen	01000	 Such is life!! Oh well.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope that I do well in this class beacuse I really need to boost my gpa up this semester.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait to get my papa john's pizza, I am so hungry.
TrainSen	01000	 Man I can't wait for Dele to get here tomorrow too.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss him so much.
TrainSen	01000	 he kind of pissed me off today though because when I was telling him about my crappy day he had to get off the phone with me.
TrainSen	01000	 Well I giess I really shouldn't be that pissed off.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm sure I have done it to him numerous times.
TrainSen	01000	 that's why I like him, he put up with my BS.
TrainSen	01000	 Wow its only been three minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't know if I can keep typing for 20.
TrainSen	01000	 this is actually harder than I though.
TrainSen	01000	 my mind is totally blank  right now.
TrainSen	01000	 Well actually its not because if it was then I would be thinking anything, but I an think about how my mind is blank.
TrainSen	01000	 so it's really not blank.
TrainSen	01000	 Ok I think I'm making things a little complicated.
TrainSen	01000	 oh my goodnes there is this weird noise coming from somewhere in my room.
TrainSen	01000	 ughhhh these stupid dorms.
TrainSen	01000	 .
TrainSen	01000	 Mann I got to a lot of homework to do tonite.
TrainSen	01000	 Well at least I'm getting one thing done.
TrainSen	01000	 That's good.
TrainSen	01000	 la la la.
TrainSen	01000	 This is getting kind of old.
TrainSen	01000	 I have about 13 minutes to go, whoops there is the phone I have to go get my pizza is ready.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I don't get counted off for this.
TrainSen	01000	 Man I'm excited about this pizza.
TrainSen	01000	 Mmmmm can't wait.
TrainSen	01000	 Man I'm really excited to eat this pizza.
TrainSen	01000	 Its going to be so good.
TrainSen	01000	 Man the smell of it makes my mouth water.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm going to keep writing a little more since I had to go get my pizza.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if my mom called me back.
TrainSen	01000	 I really don't want her to be mad at me because she gives me allownace on friday.
TrainSen	01000	 Man that's bad for me to think that.
TrainSen	01000	 but I was just kidding though.
TrainSen	01000	 Man I love chicken pizza.
TrainSen	01000	 Its so good.
TrainSen	01000	 Man that was I pretty cool assignment.
TrainSen	00100	I am so ready to go home and see my family and friends.
TrainSen	00100	 I have never really ever been by myself for this long.
TrainSen	00100	 It would not be so bad if I had at least one familiar face around but I really don't.
TrainSen	00100	 I am trying to get to know my roommates better but I guess it is not the same as knowing people and going to school with them for years.
TrainSen	00100	 In my small town we will be friends forever but here I am not so sure.
TrainSen	00100	 I really hope I can get involved with the church here.
TrainSen	00100	 I think that will help a whole lot.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to be involved in a spirit organization but the whole ""lets get drunk at every social event"" really bugs me.
TrainSen	00100	 Why can't people just have good clean fun? I love the team and the school but I can have a great time supporting them without getting drunk, high or having sex! Anyway I am looking forward to seeing the familiar.
TrainSen	00100	 I love it here and am gload I came but I am looking forward to next weekend.
TrainSen	00100	 I am really ready to see aron and my other friends.
TrainSen	00100	 This has been the longest we have been separated.
TrainSen	00100	 I pray though that if we can make it being apart that we will be together forever.
TrainSen	00100	 I love him so much.
TrainSen	00100	 We can talk about anything.
TrainSen	00100	 It is great.
TrainSen	00100	 We share so many things in common.
TrainSen	00100	 He loves God and that means the most to me.
TrainSen	00100	 It is a real balanced relationship.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow I cannot believe it has only been 7 minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 It feels like an eternity.
TrainSen	00100	 I have so many other things to be doing like spanish and reading for other classes.
TrainSen	00100	 I am kind of nervous aout my classes.
TrainSen	00100	 My major is Spanish and I am not so good at it yet.
TrainSen	00100	 Hopefully it will come with more practice.
TrainSen	00100	 Wow this retreat this weekend with the church is going to be great.
TrainSen	00100	 I cannot wait.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so ready to be around people and meet people.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to build good lasting relationships instead of just aquatances.
TrainSen	00100	 It is kind of lonely with just saying ""hi how are you?"" and then nothing past that.
TrainSen	00100	 O well.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope I am doing well in school.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't just want to be here, I want to thrive here.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to be the best that I can be with everything I do.
TrainSen	00100	 I want to be proud of myself and I want others to be proud.
TrainSen	00100	 I like having lectures and tests as apposed to homework, quizzes and tests.
TrainSen	00100	 But then again, if I mess up on a test it will be hard to get my grade back up.
TrainSen	00100	 I am shooting for A's but one or two B's would not be awful.
TrainSen	00100	 But I am studying for A's.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to start working out.
TrainSen	00100	 I have been sick though but I need to start again.
TrainSen	00100	 Maybe someone might like to go with me.
TrainSen	00100	 It is always better with someone else.
TrainSen	00100	 I am looking forward to be married, hopefully to aron, becuase we can do these things together becuase we both enjoy the same things.
TrainSen	00100	 I also wish Josh was here, it would be so much easier.
TrainSen	00100	 Hopefully he will get into college here and we can hang out more together.
TrainSen	00100	 He is like a brother to me and will always be.
TrainSen	00100	 I really miss him.
TrainSen	00100	 Hopefully he will call back but I guess I will just call him again.
TrainSen	00100	 Well these are all the things  I have been thinking about for the past couple of weeks.
TrainSen	00100	 I think about these things all the time and just think it has only been 16 minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 I wish all writing assignments were this easy.
TrainSen	00100	 I need to sign up for more experiments so I don't get behind.
TrainSen	00100	 I also need to do some passoffs.
TrainSen	00100	 Hopefully if I study them well today I can do one tomorrow and one thurs and then one friday and the only have 12 left.
TrainSen	00100	 That would be good.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder who is all coming home for homecoming? probably most people.
TrainSen	00100	 I love my little town.
TrainSen	00100	 I would not trade it for the world.
TrainSen	00100	 Those that have lived there their whole lives don't appreciate it as much as I do but they will some day.
TrainSen	00100	 I am really glad my mom married walter and that we moved there.
TrainSen	00100	 I like it that I live here cause my dad visits a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 My family is awesome.
TrainSen	00100	 They do so much for me and I thank God I have them.
TrainSen	00100	 You know another thing that bugs me about here is that so many people are liberals.
TrainSen	00001	     Great!  Just GREAT!  I already typed for ten minutes and this thing loses everything I wrote!  GERRRRRRRR! Oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 This isn't so bad.
TrainSen	00001	 So.
TrainSen	00001	 Let's seee.
TrainSen	00001	 oh that's right.
TrainSen	00001	 My eating disorder.
TrainSen	00001	 Okay.
TrainSen	00001	 I completely understand this freshmen 15 deal.
TrainSen	00001	 because I, regretfully, am a victim.
TrainSen	00001	 Yes, I, Maria Truong, cannot stop eating.
TrainSen	00001	 So scary.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm assuming that this is evidence of my subconscious depression that all freshmen are supposedly subjected to.
TrainSen	00001	 Huh.
TrainSen	00001	 Makes sense.
TrainSen	00001	 I suppose.
TrainSen	00001	 Hmmmm.
TrainSen	00001	 wwwweeelll.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm am also allergic to Austin.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't stop sneezing!  I think that perhaps my nose hasn't yet adapted itself to all this clean air as oppose to the humid smog of the one and only Houston.
TrainSen	00001	 Where are all these symptoms coming from?! So college isn't so bad.
TrainSen	00001	 Definitely a lot more freedom.
TrainSen	00001	 The first week wasn't so bad.
TrainSen	00001	 Must've been all the excitment.
TrainSen	00001	 But by the end of the second week.
TrainSen	00001	 I was craving junk food and missing home.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm better now by the way.
TrainSen	00001	 After we went home for Labor Day Weekend and I am all stocked up on junk food.
TrainSen	00001	 smiles.
TrainSen	00001	 Dang it!  Stupid fly!  Shoo fly!  Don't bother me! Okay.
TrainSen	00001	 So school is definitely killing me.
TrainSen	00001	 Too much to read and my lack of study habits definitely needs polishing.
TrainSen	00001	 But seriously though.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm a true nerd.
TrainSen	00001	 I even have the thick-rimmed glasses.
TrainSen	00001	 :) Wow.
TrainSen	00001	 Twelve minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 Almost thirteen.
TrainSen	00001	 How many pages is this double spaced on Word?  A page maybe?  Wow.
TrainSen	00001	 It sure does take me a long time to write stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 No wonder it took me forever to finish those english papaer!  FULL of nonsense.
TrainSen	00001	 Hmmm.
TrainSen	00001	 So glad I don't have english this year.
TrainSen	00001	 Hey!  My twenty minutes went by pretty fast!  Wahoo!  Notice how I've painstakingly wrote all this gramatically correct?  Well, at least I got the caps and punctuations down.
TrainSen	00001	 Go me.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait until Christmas.
TrainSen	00001	 My favorite season!  Big surprise!  Summer's fun but winter wins hands down!   So I wanted to work so I could make my own money instead of bumming off my parents all the time.
TrainSen	00001	 But all this reading is too much!  I'm STILL behind.
TrainSen	00001	 Its funny how I'm actually trying to study now when I wasn't much of a studier in high school.
TrainSen	00001	 Huh.
TrainSen	00001	 My thoughts are random.
TrainSen	10000	hi I guess I'm supposed to be thinking about what to write for the next 19 minutes and 20  seconds, I will start with charlie my boyfriend of one month exactly today.
TrainSen	10000	 long distance thing is  working out ok, I may be falling in love with him but then again he is going to be a cop and I  always said that I shouldn't marry a cop and he doesn't have a job right now so he can't take me  out that often.
TrainSen	10000	 does him not having a job make him lazy? I'm not quite sure, when I was like 14 I  made a list of the basic things that my future spouse should have I wonder where I put that or if  he would fit into any of the standards I set for my self.
TrainSen	10000	 he is the best guy I have dated so far, as  far as how he treats me and respects me so I'm doing all right for myself.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder what casey is  doing never mind she just walked in she says this asignment sucks and I agree maybe I will sue  you all for giving me carpal tunnel syndrome casey is leaving again, what a freak not really she is a  cool girl.
TrainSen	10000	 I just ate so much food added up I had a fajita and a cup of chicken enchillada soup  and an ass load of chips and queso, I'm sure that I am the most gigantic person on the planet  what if I get heartburn from that queso.
TrainSen	10000	 I am experiencing the sickness brought on by the lull in  my immune system brought on by the stress we talked about today in your class, yes  pennebaker, we do listen and you are quite entertaining, hope I don't forget to read the entire  semester, but at the rate I'm going that's what will happen, I wonder if you are married or if you  ever date your students.
TrainSen	10000	 god bless your students if so.
TrainSen	10000	 just kidding.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't believe that I am not  going to have sex for like an entire month.
TrainSen	10000	 this is craziness.
TrainSen	10000	 I usta me borderline nympho.
TrainSen	10000	 just  kidding again.
TrainSen	10000	 hmm what shows am I missing on tv for this assignment, and are you all actually  going to read these assignments, I wonder if anyone writes a suicide letter in this or like  confesses to a crime.
TrainSen	10000	 I stole a pen out of a lisa frank stationary set at walmart last year, but half  the stuff was missing out of it anyway and the pen was the best thing left, I think its somewhere  in my car there's lots of crap in my car, I need to clean it good and I need to have it washed the  leaves from the tree I park under are fucking up my paint.
TrainSen	10000	 my mother would slap me if she  heard me say fucking up anything.
TrainSen	10000	 hmmm.
TrainSen	10000	 deep breath I have gone 12 min 52 seconds so how  much longer do I have? I suck at math, I have another homework in there.
TrainSen	10000	 and I hate homework.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't really consider this homework, ugh the word homework really gets to me oh yeah I now  have lets see, 6 minutes and something, gee where is that lighter I'm not going to be able to  smoke for like until I find it.
TrainSen	10000	 after staring at this screen for 20 whole minutes I'm going to have a  headache and ah, the thought of being with my boyfriend, that's what they are talking about on  tv that would be great I miss him I wonder.
TrainSen	10000	 did I already write about how I wonder what you all are  thinking about what I'm writing.
TrainSen	10000	 I seem pretty neurotic.
TrainSen	10000	 this is a fairly easy asignment.
TrainSen	10000	 what  lawyer should I use to sue you all for this? not that I actually would or that I have grounds to sue.
TrainSen	10000	 3  minutes, three is my lucky number.
TrainSen	10000	 uh.
TrainSen	10000	 my fingernails need fixing.
TrainSen	10000	 two.
TrainSen	10000	 broken.
TrainSen	10000	 what's a girl to  do? and to think that I don't have a nail girl to go see and I'm freaked out by the oriental people  to do my nails, so I'm pretty much screwed.
TrainSen	10000	 count down-- 1 minute! yay I guess I will be seeing  you all around hope you enjoyed this tour through 20 minutes in my brain.
TrainSen	10000	 its scary I know.
TrainSen	10000	 alright  then I love charlie!!!!! I can call him now he will be so pleased.
TrainSen	00001	     Right now I am sitting here typing, with the tv on in the background and I am feeling very tired.
TrainSen	00001	 I think this is because I didn't get nearly enough sleep last night.
TrainSen	00001	 Why didn't I get enough sleep, you ask.
TrainSen	00001	 Well I don't know.
TrainSen	00001	 I usually go to bed sometime before eleven, or sometime right before twelve and sometimes after twelve.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess you could say between 11 and 12, right? Yeah.
TrainSen	00001	 And I start my day somewhere around 7:30.
TrainSen	00001	 That is NOT NEARLY enough sleep.
TrainSen	00001	 But what's funny is this is the only time of day when I feel really lethargic: around 5 or six o clock.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe it is biological.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe we all feel tired at certain points according to our bodies.
TrainSen	00001	 I think there should be a law that we all have to take siestas in the afternoon like they do in Mexico.
TrainSen	00001	 That seems glorious.
TrainSen	00001	 Not to mention it's good for you! You are more refreshed and able to handle tasks more efficiently and with more energy.
TrainSen	00001	 Even as I type I can feel myself drifting off.
TrainSen	00001	 Do not fall asleep.
TrainSen	00001	 Do not fall asleep.
TrainSen	00001	  Oh great.
TrainSen	00001	 I pressed a wrong key and now the time started over.
TrainSen	00001	 I had two minutes of typing under my belt.
TrainSen	00001	 That's beautiful, just beautiful!!! I think I will just sit here and make up for that time.
TrainSen	00001	 Doop de doop.
TrainSen	00001	 Doop de dooooop.
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 Well, I'm very glad it's Friday tomorrow.
TrainSen	00001	 Not that it makes much of a difference, but still.
TrainSen	00001	 I can sleep in on the weekend, that's a big deal to me.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not sure what I'll do with the weekend.
TrainSen	00001	 Probably catch up on reading for classes.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm really concerned about that.
TrainSen	00001	 I've been slacking off a bit and that's just awful, classes have only been in session for what, just two weeks or something.
TrainSen	00001	 Yuck.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm such a procrastinator.
TrainSen	00001	 Well, I don't know what else to talk about.
TrainSen	00001	 This is boring and I'm getting bored just doing this because I'd rather be napping.
TrainSen	00001	 Not to mention the clock says only 3 minutes and I KNOW the true time should be somewhere around five!!!! Here, this is entertainment.
TrainSen	00001	 I will type out a poem completely from memory.
TrainSen	00001	 Ladies and gentlemen, The Road Less Traveled by Robert Frost: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry I could not travel both and be one traveler, long I stood and looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black oh I saved the first for another day yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubt if I shall ever come back I shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and I, I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference.
TrainSen	00001	 What a beauty of a poem, no? I've always liked it.
TrainSen	00001	 Don't remember why I had to memorize it.
TrainSen	00001	 probably for a class way back in middle school.
TrainSen	00001	 Some people have told me they don't understand the last line.
TrainSen	00001	 I just feel secret annoyance towards them.
TrainSen	00001	 What's there not to understand?! It's clear as a bell, people!   I like Robert Frost.
TrainSen	00001	 Here's another one I know called Fire and Ice: Some say the world will end in fire Some say in ice From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire but if it had to perish twice I think I know enough of hate to say that ice is also great and would suffice  I also like Stopping by Woods On a Snowy Evening, the one that ends ""And miles to go before I sleep.
TrainSen	00001	 "" Yep.
TrainSen	00001	 Also that poem called Nothing Gold Can Stay.
TrainSen	00001	 Why do I know so much about Robert Frost you ask?! Heck you got me.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't even know.
TrainSen	00001	 I just think his poems are nice.
TrainSen	00001	 What other poets do I like.
TrainSen	00001	 That's a good question.
TrainSen	00001	 I have no idea.
TrainSen	00001	 Well, that's probably not true, but I can't think of any at the moment.
TrainSen	00001	 In Decathlon in school we studied lots of poems, by Langston Hughes and Sylvia Plath and Robert Frost (a really bad one, though) and George Meredith and lots of other peeps.
TrainSen	00001	 Some of them were cool, some were most definitely not.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I will write a poem of my own, right here, right now.
TrainSen	00001	 I call it ""The Cat Came Home"".
TrainSen	00001	 The Cat came home and he thought he was there to stay but what he didn't know was that the owners had moved away They left the lights on They left dishes in the sink The Cat came home and in a swift minute didn't know what to think Should I stay or should I go The Cat asked himself that day What should I do about this What should I say? Well The Cat found no answers just an empty litter box So he said, Eh who cares and tore up all the socks  Maybe I should get that one published!  Well my time is almost up thank goodness, so I should think of an appropriate end to this free writing assignment, a summation if you will.
TrainSen	00001	 This was mainly about poems and poets and the unsolved mystery of why I don't get enough sleep.
TrainSen	00001	 Yep, that's all.
TrainSen	00001	 Nothing too exciting.
TrainSen	00001	 And what do you expect.
TrainSen	00001	 There is absolutely nothing worthwhile on TV at this moment.
TrainSen	00100	     I enjoy doing writing assignments liek these.
TrainSen	00100	 You get to write about just about anything that pops into your mind.
TrainSen	00100	 the bad part about this type of assignment is when you really don't have anything to think about or when you have a brian fart.
TrainSen	00100	 I wounder just how my performance in this class is going to be.
TrainSen	00100	 Whether I will do poorly in the class or good or just average enough to pass the class.
TrainSen	00100	 But among those thought, I also wounder how this semester is going to go.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope that I am going to be able to do well enough to bring my GPA up so that I am able to get more scholarships fo next year.
TrainSen	00100	 Man, when I notice what I am thinking about, I notice that I really think about things that may affect me in certain ways.
TrainSen	00100	 Like doing homework for my classes or whether or not I'm going to have enough money to pay my rent or my cell phone bill or my other bills.
TrainSen	00100	 But as I take the time to think, I feel that I will be forced to get another job so that I will be able to afford all this new responseablity that I have taken on.
TrainSen	00100	 Its not always easy to write exactly what your thinking about a certain time.
TrainSen	00100	 But right now its hard for me to do anything when all I'm thinking about it how bad I feel right now.
TrainSen	00100	 Right now I have a stuffed and runny nose, and I am also sore from working out on wensday.
TrainSen	00100	 It hurts for me to walk up the stairs or to strech out of to even lift up anything heavy.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I worked myself out a little too much, I feel that I tried to push myself a little more then I should have since it was my first day working out since last semester.
TrainSen	00100	 I think I screwed myself by not continuing to workout over the summer break.
TrainSen	00100	 All I did was work to pay off some of my bills that I acquired over last semester for books and other various reasons.
TrainSen	00100	 Its funny how when you set yourself to doing something and son't pay attention to the time, time really seems to fly by.
TrainSen	00100	 Take this assignment for example.
TrainSen	00100	 I started to write what I was thinking and now that I look at how long I've been writing, I've noticed that I have already been writing for a little over 16 minutes now and it does even seem like it.
TrainSen	00100	 It merely seems like I've been writing for about 5 minutes.
TrainSen	00100	 If all the assignments were like this one, I bet pretty much every one would do good, cause its not hard to talk about what your thinking about at a particular time.
TrainSen	00100	 You can just about write about anything you want, whether it is a event happening in your life or just something you feel like getting off your chest, all you have to to is merely just type it in and be able to get it off your chest and get a grade while doing it too.
TrainSen	00010	     I havent really decided what to write about.
TrainSen	00010	 so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like I could write for a very long time.
TrainSen	00010	 I do that though, I have a journal and its handy.
TrainSen	00010	 I like to go back and read what I write and think to myself 'what an idiot'.
TrainSen	00010	 its a learning experience really, and I hope more people use journaling to express themselves.
TrainSen	00010	 Some people use online journals which at first I thought was odd because I write personal stuff in my journal.
TrainSen	00010	 I wouldn't want the internet world to read all that.
TrainSen	00010	 but then I started reading my friend's online journals and actually started one myself.
TrainSen	00010	 Katie calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she'd like to be different.
TrainSen	00010	 That reminds me of George, he is the classic conforming nonconformist.
TrainSen	00010	 he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates.
TrainSen	00010	 especially lauren.
TrainSen	00010	 their relationship is odd in that way.
TrainSen	00010	 George makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us.
TrainSen	00010	 he is an interesting person to study.
TrainSen	00010	 I am always observant but observing him is just interesting.
TrainSen	00010	 he's like a girl and I swear he has PMS.
TrainSen	00010	 we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he didn't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group (david and I didn't want to either) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually.
TrainSen	00010	 but then the next day, he still didn't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we Couldn't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea.
TrainSen	00010	 he just left.
TrainSen	00010	 he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time.
TrainSen	00010	 the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he's cool.
TrainSen	00010	 so he'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy.
TrainSen	00010	 he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know if I belive him but I really don't care.
TrainSen	00010	 the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr.
TrainSen	00010	 popular.
TrainSen	00010	 of course he wasn't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you don't care.
TrainSen	00010	 He is such a confusing boy.
TrainSen	00010	 I mean, they're all confusing but he takes the cake.
TrainSen	00010	 having liked him before, I knew what I was getting into the last time.
TrainSen	00010	 and the time before that.
TrainSen	00010	 his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky! so now I feel bad like I'm just judging everyone I know.
TrainSen	00010	 grr.
TrainSen	00010	 that's a noise I make, I make many of them.
TrainSen	00010	 I make many faces too.
TrainSen	00010	 at work john laughs at me because I can't control my expressions.
TrainSen	00010	 especially if someone says something dumb.
TrainSen	00010	 I just can't hold it in.
TrainSen	00010	 my moms the same way.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder if that's learned or inherited.
TrainSen	00010	 anyway.
TrainSen	00010	 speaking of mom, my parents moved to florida in feb.
TrainSen	00010	 and march.
TrainSen	00010	 it was ok at first because I was of the opinion that I was getting an apartment so I wouldn't be living with them and wouldn't see them much anyway.
TrainSen	00010	 but man I was wrong.
TrainSen	00010	 I visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached.
TrainSen	00010	 while I was there dad did the same annoying things he's always done, not listening, asking questions I'd just asked etc.
TrainSen	00010	 drove me nuts.
TrainSen	00010	 but now I miss them a lot.
TrainSen	00010	 I was listening to Avril Lavigne and she has a song called nobodys home.
TrainSen	00010	 and I realized that I have no where else to go.
TrainSen	00010	 this apartment is my home now and man that's depressing.
TrainSen	00010	 the kitchen is dirty, the floors are dirty, we need to steam clean, lauren and katie are bums and it took them 4 days to clean out MY cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak.
TrainSen	00010	 people would call this bitterness.
TrainSen	00010	 I like to claim that at least I'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like I tend to do.
TrainSen	00010	 I took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website.
TrainSen	00010	 it said I was an ESTP? I think.
TrainSen	00010	 anyway, part of it said that I would tell people what I think.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know how correct that is because I am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much ALL my friends will say crap.
TrainSen	00010	 Jill is the most tactless, when she and sean got together I was quite angry.
TrainSen	00010	 and still when I think about it I get angry at her.
TrainSen	00010	 why not at him? I don't get that.
TrainSen	00010	 but when I typed his name I accidentally wrote sew.
TrainSen	00010	 I am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because I keep thinking of things.
TrainSen	00010	 like today as I walked across campus I was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make.
TrainSen	00010	 I've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but I just.
TrainSen	00010	 didn't.
TrainSen	00010	 and now, even though I'm busy with papers to write etc, I really want to get creative.
TrainSen	00010	 Lauren's sewing machine is here still but it didn't work very well.
TrainSen	00010	 I can't remember how badly it ran but I should probably check that before I buy one.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know how much they'll cost either.
TrainSen	00010	 I think $150 at walmart? but I don't want a plastic one.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm sure I could break it and I'd rather have machinery than plastic.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I should inheirit mom's old one and she can get a new one.
TrainSen	00010	 but I said that once and she said no way.
TrainSen	00010	 whatev.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm tired.
TrainSen	00010	 I tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 130 I think.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't remember exactly but 6 or less hours of sleep sucks.
TrainSen	00010	 and I've been doing it for days.
TrainSen	00010	 that's probably not good.
TrainSen	00010	 another thing that's probably no bueno is that I HATE my job.
TrainSen	00010	 and this isn't like the first year I worked at culvers and I was just a lazy bum.
TrainSen	00010	 I am good at my job, I do it well, I used to enjoy serving customers.
TrainSen	00010	 but now it has  been REALLY hard to make myself go.
TrainSen	00010	 and its not like I'm just going to call in sick, I just don't want to go.
TrainSen	00010	 I want to hit almost all of my coworkers, the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place! and he's weirdly energetic.
TrainSen	00010	 and since lauren and david have told me the same, I know I'm not the only one whos creeped out by it.
TrainSen	00010	 well goodbye my 20 min were up a few sentences ago.
TrainSen	00010	 Hi.
TrainSen	00010	 My name is Shanique Annette Roberson.
TrainSen	00010	 Usually when I have to write something I like to introduce myself first.
TrainSen	00010	 I did not prewrite this I promise.
TrainSen	00010	 I was born November 27, 1985 (the day before Thanksgiving).
TrainSen	00010	 I am now 18 years old and am excited about being in the college of engineering at the University of Texas at Austin as a Biomedical engineering major.
TrainSen	00010	 I love to play sports (volleyball, softball, and track), write poetry, praise dance! and enjoy nature.
TrainSen	00010	 Some things that I would like to do before I leave Austin or before I graduate college are to go horseback riding again (preferably, to take horseback riding lessons), to go kyacking ( I don't have a clue right now as to how to spell this word), to go parasailing with a friend of mine and to visit the capitol and some of the musuems in the city.
TrainSen	00010	 I would also like to get involved in a good service organization.
TrainSen	00010	 I love service and helping other people.
TrainSen	00010	 Oh!  About my family.
TrainSen	00010	 I am the daughter of Lee and Nancy Roberson of Bay City, TX.
TrainSen	00010	 I have one older sister, Joyce Evette Roberson.
TrainSen	00010	 My father works for a nuclear plant, my mother is a teachers aide, and my sister is in the U.
TrainSen	00010	 S.
TrainSen	00010	 Navy.
TrainSen	00010	 She (my sister) has been overseas twice (yes, to Iraq as well--she said that where she was wasn't that bad at all).
TrainSen	00010	 She has now been restationed to florida.
TrainSen	00010	 This makes me really nervous sometimes because we are predicted to have a pretty bad hurricane season this year and many of them hit florida.
TrainSen	00010	 She picked a bad state to go to.
TrainSen	00010	 Anyway, I told my sister that she could go wherever she wanted as long as I could come and visit at least once (ha! Like I could really decide where she would go.
TrainSen	00010	 I just thought I'd try it).
TrainSen	00010	 She would have flown me to Iraq to go see the sites and to go see the pyramids in Egypt but my mom wouldn't let me go.
TrainSen	00010	 She didn't want the both of us over there.
TrainSen	00010	 However, I plan to go visit in Florida either during Christmas break or Spring Break.
TrainSen	00010	 My thoughts have now shifted to the Wells family.
TrainSen	00010	 This is a family or couple that I meet on a plane my eighth grade summer.
TrainSen	00010	 I had gone to National Baptist Conference in Florida and was flying back to houston by myself.
TrainSen	00010	 They told my god-mother, who was with me before the flight, that they would keep an eye on me.
TrainSen	00010	 When we got to houston we exchanged info and said we would keep in touch.
TrainSen	00010	 Now, usually when this happens, people don't really keep in touch but in this case we have kept in touch for over 4 years now.
TrainSen	00010	 We send each other cards, call each other and all that good stuff.
TrainSen	00010	 I think that that is just amazing.
TrainSen	00010	 What esle to talk about???? OK I am just getting words now.
TrainSen	00010	 (Friends, other homework, love,Oh) Let me tell you about the home I would like.
TrainSen	00010	 I was raised in a somewhat country area and I came seem to get awat from that.
TrainSen	00010	 I would like to build a big country house with a large bay area window, sunlight roof in the kitchen or some area of the house, maybe a lake, and I know that I want horses, dogs, and cats.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know why but this picture always comes into my head when I think of what I want my future home to look like.
TrainSen	00010	 Also I have to have a porch that goes all the way around with at least one swing on it and most definitely atleast one walk in closet.
TrainSen	00010	 I don't know exactly where I would like this house but I think I would like it to be somewhere in TX.
TrainSen	00010	 Time is almost up and this is about all that I can think of right now anyway so bye and I will see you next time.
TrainSen	00010	 The one and only.
TrainSen	00100	     I really do not feel homesick at the moment.
TrainSen	00100	 Today a lot of my sorority sisters were feeling so sad because they miss their families and everything at home.
TrainSen	00100	 In a way I do feel like I miss my mom and my dogs and Dallas in general but I am having too much fun in Austin.
TrainSen	00100	 More and more parties and events filled my calender as the week progressed and eventually I just got sick.
TrainSen	00100	 Literally.
TrainSen	00100	 I felt like I was spinning in bright lights and feeling more and more nauseated by the second.
TrainSen	00100	 As soon as I started feeling that way, I realized the true comfort of home that I do miss a lot.
TrainSen	00100	 Today I ended up waiting at the health center for two hours by myself and I really wanted my mom to be sitting there.
TrainSen	00100	 I felt really independent which I liked, but I also felt lost.
TrainSen	00100	 I had no support and I feel like it will be hard to not feel so sick with out my mom.
TrainSen	00100	        On another note, I am getting scared about this whole freshman fifteen thing.
TrainSen	00100	 I am eating cereal at the moment and it is ten o'clock at night.
TrainSen	00100	 It seems crazy to me.
TrainSen	00100	 Hopefully all of the walking to class will clear off the extra pounds.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel so terrible right now.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so thirsty and my mouth is super dry.
TrainSen	00100	 The doctor told me that my lymph nodes are swollen which scared me because they feel like they are going ot explode.
TrainSen	00100	 My room mate will not stop humming and it annoys me as I write this.
TrainSen	00100	 And all of her online music is driving me up the wall.
TrainSen	00100	 It is getting so hard to concentrate on this paper.
TrainSen	00100	 I am about to start getting ready for bed also because I am super tired.
TrainSen	00100	 I really don't want to go to my 8 30 class in the morning.
TrainSen	00100	 Do you know how early that is?  I am not looking forward to it.
TrainSen	00100	 I hope the class is fun.
TrainSen	00100	 It is about fashion design which interests me but I heard it is really hard and has a lot of projects.
TrainSen	00100	 I finally got water.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so excited.
TrainSen	00100	 I really like the way my room is decorated.
TrainSen	00100	 It is all pink and orange accessories and it is super cute.
TrainSen	00100	 Ow.
TrainSen	00100	 It really hurts to drink this water because of my nodes.
TrainSen	00100	 Ouch.
TrainSen	00100	 The doctor told me to inform her in case of that but I had not had a problem really.
TrainSen	00100	 My forehead itches.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like I am complaining a lot as I am nonstop writing but I guess it has just been a really rough day.
TrainSen	00100	 I really love UT though, I am having such a great time.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes me laugh that you will probably not be reading this until I am on my deathbed.
TrainSen	00100	 That will be funny.
TrainSen	00100	 I bet this writing is really bad but I am just following the rules.
TrainSen	00100	 This constant humming is really annoying me now.
TrainSen	00100	 I have already told her to stop once but she keeps on humming.
TrainSen	00100	 Oh well, I can not let it annoy me because we are best friends and room mates and all.
TrainSen	00100	 This is going ot be an  awesome year.
TrainSen	00100	 I can not wait till the time gets rolling.
TrainSen	00100	 I really feel like brushing my teeth.
TrainSen	00100	 I can still taste my Frosted Flakes.
TrainSen	00100	 Gross.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to remember to take all of my medicines for the night.
TrainSen	00100	 I always forget little but important things like that.
TrainSen	00100	 I also felt like putting on a facial mask to help my skin out.
TrainSen	00100	 My skin seems to be really sensitive to weather and location changes.
TrainSen	00100	 It kind of weird like that.
TrainSen	00100	 Well my time is almost up.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel like even though I am thinking about things, I can not really decifer what I am hearing inside my head.
TrainSen	00100	 It is kind of weird.
TrainSen	00100	 My room mate is staring at me trying to make me laugh, but the good student I am, I am trying to resist laughing.
TrainSen	00100	 Well, I am about to go to sleep and my time is almost up so good night.
TrainSen	00010	     No what do I write about?I'm typing in a computer lab,and I'm surprised there are only a few people in here.
TrainSen	00010	 It is cold in this computer lab.
TrainSen	00010	 It has gotten a lot colder in the past few days.
TrainSen	00010	 I have a quiz in chemistry and I need to study.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate must be wondering where I am.
TrainSen	00010	 Its really different in college.
TrainSen	00010	 I have a meeting at   7 tongiht, I need to study for my quiz.
TrainSen	00010	 THere is a bunch of paper next to my desk, I wonder who left it.
TrainSen	00010	 The girl next to me is typing a paper, and another girl just walked in the computer lab.
TrainSen	00010	 She is wearing a red shirt.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to eat before the cafeteria closes.
TrainSen	00010	 It closes really early.
TrainSen	00010	 The computer next to me keeps turning on and off by itself.
TrainSen	00010	 Someone else walked into the computer lab.
TrainSen	00010	 He is wearing a blue shirt and jeans.
TrainSen	00010	 The screen of the computer to my right is green.
TrainSen	00010	 The room is starting to feel colder.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to get my jacket.
TrainSen	00010	 There are noises outside the lab, it sounds like a bunch of girls.
TrainSen	00010	 I just submitted my math homework and made a 100.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder  if I misspelled any words in this.
TrainSen	00010	 I am feeling overwhelmed as I think about all the quizzes I have thursday and friday, and I still haven't gotten my calculus book.
TrainSen	00010	 I started to feel sick today, maybe because of the change in weather.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to get some sleep.
TrainSen	00010	 This room is really quiet.
TrainSen	00010	 I see people walking outside of the computer lab.
TrainSen	00010	 I wish I could go home this weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 I kind of miss my family, but it is nice here too.
TrainSen	00010	 I really like my apartment, I need to wash dishes.
TrainSen	00010	 Someone left the computer lab and knocked something over.
TrainSen	00010	 Someone walked in with a green shirt.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder how to drop this yoga class I was put in.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe I could stay in it.
TrainSen	00010	 It might be easy.
TrainSen	00010	 I feel really stressed about school, I hope I can get a 4.
TrainSen	00010	 0, I really like my biology and chemistry and psychology classes,they are interesting.
TrainSen	00010	 Only 5 more minutes.
TrainSen	00010	 I need to run tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 Its getting darker outside.
TrainSen	00010	 Its almost 6.
TrainSen	00010	 THe cafeteria closes at 7:30.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm feeling tired, but I have so many things to do.
TrainSen	00010	 and I need to get some medicine.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what my roommates doing, probably watching tv.
TrainSen	00010	 Real Worlds on tonight.
TrainSen	00010	 I wonder what my quiz will be like tomorrow.
TrainSen	00010	 I hear people talking outside.
TrainSen	01000	     wow this assignment seems pretty easy for a homework assignment.
TrainSen	01000	 unfortunately I was unable to find the OPERA page for the prescreening, so I am now doing my homework although it's actually due friday.
TrainSen	01000	 I should not procrastinate.
TrainSen	01000	 I need to go to with my roommate to eat at j2 tomorrow at 12:30, instead of at kinsolving.
TrainSen	01000	 I like kinsolving better than j2 but the food isn't too bad either.
TrainSen	01000	 my girlfriend is online right now and talking to me, I wonder what her I'M box says while it flashes on my computer monitor.
TrainSen	01000	 I will go click on it now and check.
TrainSen	01000	 she was wondering what I had to write about for psychology class.
TrainSen	01000	 I told her I had to write my stream of consciousness for 20 minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm starting to run out of things to say for this thing, although my mind is constantly thinking and putting material for me to write on this.
TrainSen	01000	 wow it's only been 3 minutes so far, I still have a long way to go.
TrainSen	01000	 I really can't think of anything to write in here.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if I should capitalize all the 'I's in this thing or now, or whether grammar matters at all.
TrainSen	01000	 oh my girlfriend IMed me again I think I'll go look at what she has to say.
TrainSen	01000	 she has to go practice chinese for her class.
TrainSen	01000	 hmm only 4 minutes now, I don't' think I can write for another 16 minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if I can just stop writing right now and just turn it in at the end of the 20 minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 but wow this thinking is actually still providing material for me to write in this thing.
TrainSen	01000	 stil a lot of time left, my hands are starting to get fatigued, and my contacts are drying up.
TrainSen	01000	 it's getting late and I'm getting tired at the same time.
TrainSen	01000	 should I go to my math class tomorrow or not.
TrainSen	01000	 my roommate is playing a really loud tv show, it appears to be star trek enterprise, I can't really concentrate with it playing in the backgrond.
TrainSen	01000	 I am really tempted to watch it though, instead of writing this thing, but I suppose I should write this anyway.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to take a shower too, but I can't because I have to write in this thing for another 13 minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 the reptilians will take their place.
TrainSen	01000	 Says the tv show.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to watch the show now I think I will.
TrainSen	01000	 my roommate is pouring water into a cup and drinking from it.
TrainSen	01000	 my body is a bit sore from working out at gregory earlier this evening.
TrainSen	01000	 I also have a canker sore in my mouth and it does hurt a little.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I will ask the psychology teacher tomorrow about the prescreening thing.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if I'm spelling tomorrow correctly.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I will go on to dictionary.
TrainSen	01000	 Com and check.
TrainSen	01000	 it appears I have spelled 'tomorrow' correctly after all.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm satrting to just space out while writing this thing, and getting rather tired.
TrainSen	01000	 I like playing espn football 2k5.
TrainSen	01000	 I usually beat my friend matt in it, but not my friend philip.
TrainSen	01000	 I have been playing for the past two hours, maybe that is why I am tired now.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if my girlfriend is done studying her chinese yet.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm going to go check her profile.
TrainSen	01000	 she is still away.
TrainSen	01000	 I want a glass of water, I think I will go pour one for myself.
TrainSen	01000	 I found a bottle of ozarka that I got from my friend so I am drinking out of that.
TrainSen	01000	 my roommate explained to me that the star trek episode he is watching is based on the time when humans just reached space and are pioneering it, a few hundred years before captain kirk.
TrainSen	01000	 even though the series is rather new.
TrainSen	01000	 it seems interesting.
TrainSen	01000	 my girlfriend is having trouble memorizing chinese.
TrainSen	01000	 my friend clinton called and is now talking to me.
TrainSen	01000	 it will be hard to multitask.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm not really paying attention to him.
TrainSen	01000	 he is asking me if I am eating with other friends.
TrainSen	01000	 my friend did not get a bid for a frat, so he will not be pledging.
TrainSen	01000	 we are going to a party on friday.
TrainSen	01000	 perhaps with kdphi sorority.
TrainSen	01000	 my girlfriend is asking what I am writing about again, and is falling asleep from doing homework.
TrainSen	10000	     I always have a million thoughts going on in my head but now that I am asked to write about them, I can't.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder where the printers are.
TrainSen	10000	 its already 7:40.
TrainSen	10000	 its so quiet in here.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if this girl next to me knows where to print.
TrainSen	10000	 it looks like she's buisy.
TrainSen	10000	 this keyboard is dirty, the keys are hard to press.
TrainSen	10000	 I shouldn't have thrown away my smoothie.
TrainSen	10000	 its so dull in here.
TrainSen	10000	 its already getting dark.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I'm spelling okay.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't wait until tomorrow.
TrainSen	10000	 ""and I love you, and its more then I ever knew.
TrainSen	10000	 "" (I'm singing in my head).
TrainSen	10000	 its too quiet, like we're not allowed to talk, its kind of depressing.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm so glad I learned to type.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I can download my calculus homework on this computer.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I understand it.
TrainSen	10000	 this weekend I go home.
TrainSen	10000	 but the best part is going to be the six hour drive with my boyfriend.
TrainSen	10000	 he's great.
TrainSen	10000	 and I love him more everyday.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope this feeling lasts.
TrainSen	10000	 I would love to marry him, in like 6 years.
TrainSen	10000	 he's great and we're great together, I miss him.
TrainSen	10000	 I just saw him yesterday but I miss him.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm hungry.
TrainSen	10000	 I think ill take dinner up to my room and socialize with my roommate.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder what I'm going to eat today.
TrainSen	10000	 I had a sandwhich yesterday.
TrainSen	10000	 I should eat something hot.
TrainSen	10000	 hmm.
TrainSen	10000	 I guess I could have chicken strips.
TrainSen	10000	 or vegetables.
TrainSen	10000	 oo, and a salad.
TrainSen	10000	 is that how you spell oo.
TrainSen	10000	 oh, eww, uh, oo.
TrainSen	10000	 ? oh well.
TrainSen	10000	 now its 7:48.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if I need glasses? this watch is bothering me.
TrainSen	10000	 ah, there.
TrainSen	10000	 my foot hurts so much.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder when the swelling will go down.
TrainSen	10000	 I should email my dad.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope my string doesn't come off.
TrainSen	10000	 I forgot to put my rings back on.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I don't lose them.
TrainSen	10000	 tomorrow I have an easy day, and I get to see fili.
TrainSen	10000	 yah.
TrainSen	10000	 yeh.
TrainSen	10000	 ya.
TrainSen	10000	 whatever.
TrainSen	10000	 my head hurts.
TrainSen	10000	 I should eat.
TrainSen	10000	 what did I eat today.
TrainSen	10000	 cereal.
TrainSen	10000	 soup.
TrainSen	10000	 hmm.
TrainSen	10000	 I should eat dinner after this.
TrainSen	10000	 I have so much reading to do.
TrainSen	10000	 but its labor day weekend, so ill do a little bit each day and then finish this weekend.
TrainSen	10000	 wow, my time is almost up.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I'm doing this right.
TrainSen	10000	 hmm.
TrainSen	10000	 I think so.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I could gain weight, well in certain places more then others.
TrainSen	10000	 now someone else is sitting next to me.
TrainSen	10000	 hmm.
TrainSen	10000	 its so weird how there are so many oriental students here, its almost as if they are the majority.
TrainSen	10000	 but that can't be right.
TrainSen	10000	 it must just seem that way.
TrainSen	10000	 there are so many people and I don't know any of them.
TrainSen	10000	 someones chair keeps squeaking.
TrainSen	10000	 oh, I need to sign up for those informal classes.
TrainSen	10000	 what is that ringing.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't think cell phones are allowed in here.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to write a letter to danny.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if hanna plays this weekend.
TrainSen	10000	 I know they do.
TrainSen	10000	 but where? hmm I need to find out, but soon.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if I should tell my parents about me going home this weekend or just surprise them.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know which one is better or worse.
TrainSen	10000	 oh well.
TrainSen	10000	 that chair squeaked again.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't see any printers.
TrainSen	10000	 hmm.
TrainSen	10000	 I should stop looking around, people are looking at me funny.
TrainSen	10000	 its almost eight.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to read.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if the timer goes past twenty minutes or if it keeps going.
TrainSen	10000	 well that answers my question.
TrainSen	10000	     I'm sitting in my dorm room and it's very cold.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't think we control the temperature in our room because sometimes it's hot and sometimes it's cold no matter what temperature setting we put it on.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm borrowing my roommate's computer because I don't have one yet.
TrainSen	10000	 My dad is going to bring it up hopefully this weekend when my parents come for my brothers soccer tournament.
TrainSen	10000	 I also want him to get me a new cell phone because my phone book is full on mine and I can't put any new numbers in it which is difficult considering we're in college and I'm meeting quite a few new people.
TrainSen	10000	 Many of the people I met because I went through rush and also I've met a lot of people on my dorm hall.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm living in srd.
TrainSen	10000	 The food is pretty good but I'm really picky.
TrainSen	10000	 Bretani was eating mushroom soup today and I think soup and mushrooms are gross she said I was missing out on so many great things because I was so picky but I don't like to try foods I've already got preconceived notions about as being not good.
TrainSen	10000	 I like pizza.
TrainSen	10000	 I really miss eating dominoes pizza on friday nights.
TrainSen	10000	 I was thinking about the zebra thing we talked about in class and I was wondering that: if zebras are always releasing cortozol (not sure on spelling) and their immune systems are always being shut down in response, then why are zebras never sick? wouldn't they be sick like all the time? or are they sick and we just don't know it?? maybe you would have to do some serious research on zebras to find this out at least that's what me and claire concluded.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm glad that claire is here with me at UT even though we weren't like really really close friends in highschool I've known her since kindergarten which is pretty remarkable to know someone for that long.
TrainSen	10000	 from kindergarten to college I mean.
TrainSen	10000	 I've been calling a lot of my high school friends.
TrainSen	10000	 mainly when I'm bored like when I was waiting for the bus the other day for like thirty minutes seriously it took so long.
TrainSen	10000	 And the guy behind me had a pizza and it smelled so good.
TrainSen	10000	 I go visit jeff a lot (my bf) because I think about him a lot and I wish I could see him at least every day but that might not be possible considering I have a lot of home work I have to do and all the other stuff I'm going to be responsible for once school and equestrian team gets going and it's sucks because he doesn't have a car so he can't just drop by even though I drop by his place like all the time I did at home too .
TrainSen	10000	 I'm always trying to surprise him or make him happy and it just sucks that guys don't get girls.
TrainSen	10000	 They're dating impaired almost all of them suffer from this ailment I would say.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean some things seem so obvious for him to do to just make me so happy.
TrainSen	10000	 Little things I mean and he doesn't even see them but as long as I'm complaining about jeff at least I'm not going out with andy.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't see how bret (my roommate who I know from highschool) can go out with him.
TrainSen	10000	 He's such a close minded person.
TrainSen	10000	 A lot of the time just a jerk.
TrainSen	10000	 And everyone who meets him get's that first impression from him too.
TrainSen	10000	 And I just think bret is way too good for him but for some reason she loves him and I know he loves her and he's not a bad guy but the other day talking about wanting to live with a gay guy like will and grace or be friends with a gay person he was like ""well then you'd just be condoning that life style"" omg what a freakin aggie seriously, he's such a hick I can't believe he would be so close minded but he is and his ego is so huge and bret is pissed off at him all the time and the long distance relationship thing just isn't go to work so iwish she'd just dump him because I think he's a jerk.
TrainSen	10000	 If he wasn't her bf I probably wouldn't even be friends with him.
TrainSen	10000	 Yikes any way I can really get carried away on that issue .
TrainSen	10000	 I miss going out to the barn everymorning.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm afraid I'm going to gain weight because I don't have the motivation to jjust exercise and I don't dance everyday like I used to and I just ate two cups of ice cream and even though it's fat free bret says it still has like a jillion calories and I don't even really know what that means/entails but it sounds like something that will make me gain weight.
TrainSen	10000	 And I guess I'm just really concerned with that.
TrainSen	10000	 I also don't know about this whole sorority thing I'm a DG and the girls are great but sometimes I just wish that I had gotten a bid fro chi o because I spent like hours killing myself over that decision and I got DG in the end anyway.
TrainSen	10000	 And sometimes they baby you and you're like uh I think I can handle life here thank you very much but oh well at least you have people watching out for you whether it's a little annoying or not and it does make me feel precious.
TrainSen	10000	 karolyn stopped by last night just to tuck us in and that made me feel special.
TrainSen	10000	 Sometimes I go crazy learning about psycology because sometimes I think it's just ridiculous to study why we do things and you know like ""if you sit on this side of the room will you be more likely to eat spinach"" or something because I just wonder why we study it instead of just leaving it alone and living it.
TrainSen	10000	 it just seems like a scientist was really bored one day and unknowingly decide to start a study of something absolutely crazy.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't even know what I'm saying but sometimes I don't care or want to know why we do what we do.
TrainSen	10000	 We just do it! and that's it why should we stress ourselves out trying to solve the mystery of everything why not just live it.
TrainSen	10000	 Man I drive myself crazy sometimes.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm going to eat a red hot fire ball now.
TrainSen	10000	 Actually they're called atomic fireballs.
TrainSen	10000	 I noticed that last night.
TrainSen	10000	 Me and jeff are going stargazing on the RLM tonight.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope it works out because I don't know too much about it.
TrainSen	10000	 Ok did it not even bother bret when andy made that incredibly ignorant comment about being gay? because he says jerky stuff all the time and somehow she just sees past it to how wonderful he is.
TrainSen	01000	     I hate escalators.
TrainSen	01000	 Don't know why.
TrainSen	01000	 I've always just hated them.
TrainSen	01000	 Or maybe I'm afraid of them too.
TrainSen	01000	 My right foot feels really numb.
TrainSen	01000	 And not Comfortably Numb like that Pink Floyd song.
TrainSen	01000	 Just numb.
TrainSen	01000	 Pink Floyds OK, somewhere up there with Verve Pipe and Nirvana.
TrainSen	01000	 There's this guy lousing back on the lobby across from me.
TrainSen	01000	 He's wearing a fedora that's covering his eyes.
TrainSen	01000	 He looks cool.
TrainSen	01000	 Fedoras are cool.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder why guys stopped wearing them.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean they look cool, especially in those old film-noir movies like The Big Sleep.
TrainSen	01000	 I have no freakin' idea what that movie was about.
TrainSen	01000	 The plot kept jumping like some kind of a grasshoper but it was OK.
TrainSen	01000	 Some girls next to me are chattering/giggling.
TrainSen	01000	 I hate it when people giggle that way.
TrainSen	01000	 Its annoying.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I don't giggle that way then I'd be annoyed with myself.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder what it would be like to be somebody else.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean what if I was the guy resting back on that couch? Would I be the same person in someonelse's body? Or someone different.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if a different body makes you be different.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I had my CD player with me.
TrainSen	01000	 Life sucks without it.
TrainSen	01000	 Then again, it'll suck either way so I guess the CD player doesn't make much of a difference.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm humming the tune to Something Stupid.
TrainSen	01000	 Cute song.
TrainSen	01000	 Though what the hell was up with Sinatra singing that with his daughter? Freak.
TrainSen	01000	 But he's a cool freak.
TrainSen	01000	 The weather here is always so damn sunny.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't like sunny weather, it gives me a sun burn.
TrainSen	01000	 I like it when the sky's all grayscale and it looks like its about to splatter down light rain.
TrainSen	01000	 That's my kind of scenery.
TrainSen	01000	 Always has been.
TrainSen	01000	 Don't know why.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm yawning now, even though I'm not all that tired.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder what the girl next to me is thinking.
TrainSen	01000	 She looks like she's in really deep thought.
TrainSen	01000	 Maybe she's thinking about lunch.
TrainSen	01000	 No, lunch is over.
TrainSen	01000	 Dinner.
TrainSen	01000	 Yeah, maybe she's thinking about dinner.
TrainSen	01000	 I can't wait until this week is over.
TrainSen	01000	 What time is it? There's never a clock when I need one.
TrainSen	01000	 Life's inconveniences.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm looking at my wrist, at my nonexistant watch wondering what time is it.
TrainSen	01000	 Hope I'm not late to class.
TrainSen	01000	 Then again I was early to class the other day because I had my watch on upside down.
TrainSen	01000	 My nails are too big, I need to cut them before I get a hangnail or something.
TrainSen	01000	 My foots still numb, I wish the bloody thing would wake up since I've got a class to get to.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss my friends back home.
TrainSen	01000	 Hell I even miss my paranoid, stark-raving-lunatic of a mother.
TrainSen	01000	 How pathedic.
TrainSen	01000	 .
TrainSen	01000	 I need a new pinky ring, this ones all rusty and broken down but I'm too attached to it.
TrainSen	01000	 Its like one of those mothers that knows they have an ugly baby but love it anyway.
TrainSen	01000	 Hey fedora-guy just woke up.
TrainSen	01000	 Yeah, he's stretching his legs now.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if my leg will ever move now.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder why people can't fly.
TrainSen	01000	 I mean who wants cars and airplanes/jets when you can fly? That would be cool.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I could fly.
TrainSen	01000	 But I wouldn't want wings, those would be too annoying to take care of.
TrainSen	01000	 I also wish I could play the piano.
TrainSen	01000	 But I guess desire never equals talent.
TrainSen	01000	 Reminds me of Saliaree.
TrainSen	01000	 Amadeus was a great movie.
TrainSen	01000	 Great story.
TrainSen	01000	 Fedora-dude is gone now, some other guy has taken his seat.
TrainSen	01000	 He's not wearing a hat, but its OK.
TrainSen	01000	 This guy's got long eye-lashes and a pointy nose.
TrainSen	01000	 Pretty cool.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if someday I'll wake up and everything was just one big nightmare.
TrainSen	01000	 That would be great.
TrainSen	01000	 I could start over.
TrainSen	01000	 But knowing my luck, I'd just make the same mistakes.
TrainSen	00001	it is a beautiful day outside and I hope to enjoy it as best I should I am listening to one of my favorite bands.
TrainSen	00001	 this song matches my mood perfectly.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel like I should be doing something with my life and I'm not, and it's very har to get along in this university without feeling lonely now and then.
TrainSen	00001	 I find beauty in very conventionally ugly things and this is why I love photography so much.
TrainSen	00001	 the pictures I have up on my walls reflect my personality a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 there are so many aspects of me that people never get to see and it hurts when they judge without knowing me personally.
TrainSen	00001	 I see in color in the sense that I see the most vibrancy and brightness in everything.
TrainSen	00001	 my room here is finally starting to smell lik ehome and that's one of the first things I notice when I come in.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm glad I ended up at ut.
TrainSen	00001	 I thought I was kind of chickening out by coming here.
TrainSen	00001	 it's the only place I applied to.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm a freshman this year and I really hope to get out in 3 years, since I have 34 hours of credit from exams.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I can get out in 3 years because I want to feel good about myself and not feel inferior to my peers.
TrainSen	00001	 I have a lot of issues about who I am and that's why psychology fascinates me so.
TrainSen	00001	 I understand a lot of who I am more than most people my age.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm feeling very wise right now and although my boyfriend is a year older than me, I sometimes feel years older than him.
TrainSen	00001	 I might want to marry him someday and I worry about that.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss the way things were 2 years ago when I was carefree I feel very burdened and I sometimes think I'm not experiencing college because I feel that way so often.
TrainSen	00001	 I've always had so much to do that when I don't, I can't relax and I get really anxious.
TrainSen	00001	 if I'm not stressed out I think I'm missing something.
TrainSen	00001	 when I watched president bush speak last night I cried because I'm so worried that he will be reelected.
TrainSen	00001	 I am an avid kerry fan and feel passionately about politics and when I hear bush lie and make empty promises and see people believe what he's saying it affects me deeply.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to make a difference in the world someday.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I will grow to be someone great.
TrainSen	00001	 my past relationships have been sneaking up on me recently an d things on that front are disturbing an dmaking me feel regretful.
TrainSen	00001	 I there are some things that I remember so perfectly about the past and I don't know why they stick out.
TrainSen	00001	 I know that there is something special inside me and I hope I can do something great in this world.
TrainSen	00001	 I remember going to europe two years ago and feeling so happy with myself and who I was and I don't have any clue about that anymore.
TrainSen	00001	 I find peace in knowledge.
TrainSen	00001	 wondering stresses me out.
TrainSen	00001	 I used to write a lot of poetry and I still feel just as expressive but now the words don't flow as well.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that as I've grow up, my poetic naivete has faded as has any talent I had.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel bery inferior to people that don't know me they look at me like I have no self worth and it bothers me.
TrainSen	00001	 I am a government major and a psych minor but some people think because I'm in liberal arts I have no direction in my life and that is so frustrating.
TrainSen	00001	 it frustrates me when people think I am stupid.
TrainSen	00001	 I have almost no tolerance for ignorance yet I get mad when people do that.
TrainSen	00001	 I am very analytical, mayb eoveranalytical, and its gotten me into a lot of trouble in my life I miss conor and what we had a few years ago and I miss our friendship I need to feel safe and comforted in order to be successful and I am very dependent on other people in my life to do that for me.
TrainSen	00001	 when we weren't 100 miles apart I miss justin in many ways and that bothers me he was the most detrimental person in my life and still is so far and last night I was thinking about those three days that were the worst in my life and there is only 1 thing I can do to get past that.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know if I will ever.
TrainSen	00001	 one of my main goals in life is to be understood and I feel very misunderstood by people that don't take the time to get to know me and I feel that the first impressions I give are not very accurate.
TrainSen	00001	 I am very emotional and I know that just thinking about certain things will make me burst into tears it makes me feel inferior to do that.
TrainSen	00001	 I feel guilty when I cry because things could be a lot worse.
TrainSen	00001	 I want this world to improve and I want to help it do so.
TrainSen	00001	 I need a lot of love.
TrainSen	00001	 ramon and I have something really special he makes me feel so loved we have been together for two whole years and I want to be with him forever I want to make him happy and I want him to make me happy until we are old and I want to share everything I have with him.
TrainSen	00001	 I wasn't sure about that until recently but now I feel more passionately about our relationship than I ever have.
TrainSen	00001	 sometimes I cry out of neither sadness nor happiness and its hard to explain to anyone else it feels like I cry out of understanding a complex emotion that I never was able to before.
TrainSen	00001	 if a song really touches me and I connect to it I will almost definitely cry.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that makes me special.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I am more compassionate than most people.
TrainSen	00001	 music is one of the most powerful mediums of communication there is it makes me feel freer than anything else except possibly writing.
TrainSen	10000	     Ok.
TrainSen	10000	 just got done crying because of stupid high school people I never want to talk to again.
TrainSen	10000	 The shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I don't misspell too many things.
TrainSen	10000	 I am sniffingly so loud.
TrainSen	10000	 I should go get a tissue.
TrainSen	10000	 I never did learn how to type right on this thing.
TrainSen	10000	 Why did my thoughts just totally flip?  Wow, that's weird.
TrainSen	10000	 Brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics.
TrainSen	10000	 I really wish I could concentrate for more than 2 seconds when I'm emotional.
TrainSen	10000	 It really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until I can see straight.
TrainSen	10000	 But I won't be crying any more hopefully as I am cutting off those jerks from high school.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't need than, nor do I wan them in any aspect of my life.
TrainSen	10000	 They just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, London tell them how you really feel!  I hate computers when I have fake nails.
TrainSen	10000	 I always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done.
TrainSen	10000	 My back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground.
TrainSen	10000	 I think it's time to switch positions.
TrainSen	10000	 Ah.
TrainSen	10000	 Much better.
TrainSen	10000	 Now my typing skills really stink.
TrainSen	10000	 It's really hard to lay on the ground and type.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh I have a laptop.
TrainSen	10000	 That would be stupid to do if I had a regular PC.
TrainSen	10000	 I still can't get comfortable.
TrainSen	10000	 The floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed.
TrainSen	10000	 That's better.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know why I didn't get on the bed in the first place.
TrainSen	10000	 AHHH!!  Yes, I do I don't want to be on my white comforter!!  Oh no!!  You know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be.
TrainSen	10000	 You would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me.
TrainSen	10000	 Stupid back gives me problems all the time.
TrainSen	10000	 I miss Dr.
TrainSen	10000	 Jones!!  I don't know how I'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever I hurt.
TrainSen	10000	 It just occurred to me that I might be using AIM abbreviations in this writing thing.
TrainSen	10000	 That might not make me look too smart.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh, well.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't want to go back and look at it.
TrainSen	10000	 It would just take to long.
TrainSen	10000	 God, my nose is still stopped up.
TrainSen	10000	 My skin is drying out to.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to wash my face and moisturize.
TrainSen	10000	 I forgot how to spell moisturize!!!  I had to retypr it like three times.
TrainSen	10000	 You know for someone who is supposed to be smart, I am pretty dumb sometimes.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if Pennebaker thought I was dumb in class today.
TrainSen	10000	 I zoned out a little bit and then raised my hand and said something that did not fit with what he was looking for.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I could just leave all the bad behind me, then maybe I could pay attention in class.
TrainSen	10000	 But no.
TrainSen	10000	 I have to be all sensitive and worry about everyone and everything that someone else should be caring about.
TrainSen	10000	 I seriously need to just be tough and tell people to back off me.
TrainSen	10000	 I was going to use a bad word, but I don't know if that would be appropriate.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if it would affect my grade if I did write a cuss word.
TrainSen	10000	 Is that how you spell cuss?  Maybe I should have just wrote curse.
TrainSen	10000	 And why do I always have to fix the word just?  Every time I type just without paying close attention I put an extra j in between the u and the s.
TrainSen	10000	 It makes me feel quite stupid.
TrainSen	10000	 Time just ran out.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm glad because I want to just go to sleep and forget about people  I will never have to see again.
TrainSen	01000	     Today is the first football game, I'm pretty excited.
TrainSen	01000	 Idon't really know the drill so  hopefully my friend willcall.
TrainSen	01000	 I wonder if there is a parade, that'd be cool I could go  listen to the band, I miss band band was fun if I don't make the dance team I'm  definately going to try  out for band, although my lips are so fat  I can't believe joe  said that about my lips sometimes I really wonder about that kid, he sure does tell  a lot of stories, I mean seriously he couldn't have gotten kicked out of new orleans  theyll take anyone over there, youd have to do a whole hell of a lot to get kicked  out of there I wonder how megans doing in alabama she found a new male friend I  wonder about her and jason if they are going to stay together they are one of  those couples that are going to stay together forever save a nuclear winter.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish I  could be like that but at the same time I'm having fun I guess, I really miss griff, he  always made me smile even if it was something stupid, I need to go visit him at  atm I wonder how much different it is over there if it really is a bunch of cowboys  like I picture it I wonder if erin likes it since she's not into the whole spirit cowboy  thing, I think she would do so much better here with me! plus I mjust miss erin.
TrainSen	01000	 she  was so cool I loved our no pants parties, they were fun bonding time.
TrainSen	01000	 man 20 min  is longer than I thought suck town usa, I think this assignment is kind of cool to track  your htoughts for 20 min, it just proves further how random I am, I'm hungry, I think  I'm going to have a pb&j when I'm done, that's the stuff with strawberry jelly.
TrainSen	01000	 strawberries whiten your teeth that is so cool I need to start using my crest white  strips again, I need to take a shower, man I forgot how far away kirby lane isthat  power walk made me all nappy.
TrainSen	01000	 that's ok I'm sure ill get even nappier at the f-ball  game amin is so hot, man did I luck out on getting a counselor, nate was so cool  too! I'd totally date nate.
TrainSen	01000	 that's the kind of guy I'm looking for, random funnyness  facial expressions everything someone that canjust make me laugh up a storm.
TrainSen	01000	 OTherwhise ill get bored.
TrainSen	01000	 I kind of want someone like griff though too.
TrainSen	01000	 Although if I  dated griff I'd be really scared.
TrainSen	01000	 Idon't know why, idon't htink he'd ever cheat on  anyone but he never wants a girlfriend.
TrainSen	01000	 manhes good.
TrainSen	01000	 really strong.
TrainSen	01000	 he can bench  press me that's amazing I need to work out I don't want that nasty freshman 15.
TrainSen	01000	 I  don't think ill get it I walk around campus like hardcore.
TrainSen	01000	 its a big campus I like it  though I like getting lsot in it all its definately puts me in my place.
TrainSen	01000	 which is nice.
TrainSen	01000	 no  more trying to be something imnot.
TrainSen	01000	 I hope I can find an organization to be in.
TrainSen	01000	 the  wrangler darlins would be pretty awesome and pals would be pretty cool.
TrainSen	01000	 I  wouldlove to get a really hot italian boy.
TrainSen	01000	 man that would be cool.
TrainSen	01000	 like hardcore  awesome.
TrainSen	01000	 like paolo or davide or vincente that would be awesome this takes a  long time I'm having trouble trying to fill up the time I wonder when my roommate is  going to wake up its like 1:00 in the afternoon.
TrainSen	01000	 Iwanna take a nap I think I will.
TrainSen	01000	 naps  are the greatest.
TrainSen	01000	 I didn't used to like them but man are they awesome.
TrainSen	01000	 especially  after reading philosophy, stupid philosophy its so boring but the lectures are cool.
TrainSen	01000	 I  don't know I usually don't like to discuss abortion and stuff like that because your  not going to change anyones mind so what's the point in fighting because that's all  your doing is fighting I don't like to fight I think its stupid because your hurting other  people and not gaining anything from it so its useless hurt thatno one needs ihate  pain I hate to make other people sad I hate to be sad.
TrainSen	01000	 good thing I like it here or I  might be misreable almost done 17  min and 30 seconds.
TrainSen	01000	 sweet this has taken  forever I should be reading something or studying or something like that I want to  do well in colllege grade wise ireally want to make a 3.
TrainSen	01000	 8 at least my mom made a  4.
TrainSen	01000	 0 in really hard classes last semester now granted that's my mom and she isn't  doing as much socially as I am so she has more time to study, well actually she  workds all the time.
TrainSen	01000	 I never really realized how hard she must have worked.
TrainSen	10000	I do not feel well at all, I wonder if it was the tequila from last night or worrying about a girl.
TrainSen	10000	 Sometimes I don't know why I am still with her.
TrainSen	10000	 Can you still have feelings for someone that you find annoying? Why am I doing this Writing Assignment now my stomach and head are killing me.
TrainSen	10000	 I should have tried to pawn it off on one of my roommates for ten dollars or something because who wants to right about what ""they"" think, I'm more interested in what other people think about.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean I alrdy know what I think about, its boring to me, what about the people I don't know, what do they think about, that's what I want to know.
TrainSen	10000	 I know that girl down there is thinking about something, some psycologist needs to figure out how to read girls, that's what they should be working on, why learn about depression, figure out what girls think about.
TrainSen	10000	 Honestly, I don't think a single man can tell me what a girl is thinking at any given time, half the time they hate you other half they love you and it can switch just as fast.
TrainSen	10000	 What's the deal with that!  I am still feeling bad my stomach won't stop hurting, I think I need to get something to eat.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to get feeling better cause I already have plans for tonight, and it sucks going out when you don't feel well.
TrainSen	10000	 When I go out and I don't feel well, I get extremely annoyed with everyone that I am with.
TrainSen	10000	 It's probably because they are having more fun then I am.
TrainSen	10000	 I have noticed that school is obsessed with talking about politics, in every class I go to we talk about Bush and Kerry.
TrainSen	10000	 YES, 3 more minutes to go on the assignment, but too much politics in my opinion half the time it has no correlation with the subject at hand.
TrainSen	10000	 In my Spanish class we had a 30 minute discussion about economic poilices, how does that help me with Hola Como estas? This assignment isn't bad, its like the people that have journals, who put there mind on paper.
TrainSen	10000	     it is really cold in my room, my roommate likes it that way.
TrainSen	10000	 and for some unknown reason it is a lot colder in our room than it is in the rest of the apartment, so we walk around and it is hot and then we come into our room and it is freezing.
TrainSen	10000	 Awesome, I hope I can make to class on time today cause writing for 20 minutes might put me a little late, oh well it is history and I usually don't go anyway, and why is that? Why is it that some people are extremely motivated to do well and make the good grades whereas there are people like me who could honestly care less.
TrainSen	10000	 is it the parents? I doubt that cause mine are extremely motivated I am wearing jeans and boots today, and my roommate told me that it was wierd cause I don't look so goofy my mouse just messed up.
TrainSen	10000	 if I can make it through this whole writing assignment without losing my wireless internet connection I will be extremely impressed, sad huh?  anyways I really want to go to arkansas this weekend for the game, one of these years I am going to get a ticket to every texas gamand go, although this would be the year cause they really don't have any games that are that far away.
TrainSen	10000	 my roommate took psycology last year, did I spell that right? anyways I don't think he had to do anything like this.
TrainSen	10000	 I need to call my mom, havent talked to her in a few days, she likes it whenever I call.
TrainSen	10000	 I do call home a whole lot more than the rest of the guys I know, I am such a mamma's boy.
TrainSen	10000	 I really like the shirt that I am wearing lime green, some say gay, I say nice.
TrainSen	10000	 yeah really nice, man this is starting to get hard and I have only been writing for 8 minutes, I don't know if I have thought for 20 minutes straight in my whole life.
TrainSen	10000	 I really don't my brain just shuts off and I space out.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 especially during class.
TrainSen	10000	 sometimes I wonder if I have that ADD crap.
TrainSen	10000	 I have always been told that I do but since I made good grades in school they never took me to go get evaluated or anything like that.
TrainSen	10000	 school.
TrainSen	10000	 the only thing I miss about high school is football, that was my life, coach always said it would be the best time I ever had but I never believed him until I was done playing and trust me.
TrainSen	10000	 it was.
TrainSen	10000	 I mean I have a lot of fun in college meeting new  people and getting drunk all the time but I really miss playing ball.
TrainSen	10000	 this damn song, my roommate plays the same songs all the time, never good songs, and yet he plays the same ones over and over again, hold on I have to write for psyc, be there in 9 minutes, he wants me to read something for him.
TrainSen	10000	 coke, I love coke for some reason, not that is tastes good cause I really don't think the taste is good at all and yet I drink it all the time, like it is an addictive taste.
TrainSen	10000	 addictive, I think I have  a very addictive personality, if there is such a thing, like snuff, I never would have thought that I would start having cravings for snuff, and yet I do like right now, where did I put my can? oh man this sucks can't find it , I can wait untill I get done only 6 more minutes, hands are starting to get a little tired of doing this, had a dream last night, and I think in it I called my ex-girlfriend, sometimes I have dreams with her in them, and I don't know why, its wierd, don't really care for her or anything, just sometimes she is in my dreams, speaking of dreams I could use a nap right about now, man I slept till 10 and am still tired, whatever happened to that this is the guy who would get up a 530 to go to the weight room everymorning in high school and I come to college and now getting up a 10 is early? that is like 4 and a half hours later,I could quite possibly be the laziest person on this earth, just might be actually, they could conduct a study and I think I would be the laziest.
TrainSen	10000	 .
TrainSen	10000	 Except for all the homeless people, twice in a row, he has the song on repeat, how in the hell could somebody listen to the same song twice in a row, ok I got to say something not again I don't even like this song he put on now, ok this one isn't bad 1 more minute, cramp in the forearm, am I going to make tat fica plant looks it really good I really hope you don't look into as long as I submit it is very hard 5 more seconds I can't wait done.
TrainSen	00010	     Well, I woke up this morning scared because I was dreaming! I think I was dreaming that I was being chased by somebody and I was running like hell!  My roommate Kate woke me up because we were a little bit late to school and I jumped out of bed like I was on fire! I scared her just getting out of bed!! hahahaha! It was pretty funny, I guess!! Wow, it is a BEAUTIFUL day outside!  It's all cloudy and I hope it rains all weekend.
TrainSen	00010	 The news said it would but I really hope they are right!! So, there's this guy that just got up and left.
TrainSen	00010	 He looked maybe familiar but maybe not! He was wearing a red shirt and he looked kind of silly! Hahahahaha!!  Now this other girl just sat down to use the computer and she looks a little bit irritated!  I might be wrong but she's hitting the keys like she wants to kill!! I don't know.
TrainSen	00010	 maybe she just type's hard.
TrainSen	00010	 or something!! OH Yeah!  I had a good time in my math class today.
TrainSen	00010	 I actually learned something!! It was pretty cool! You know, I come from a really tiny place outside of El Paso called Fabens.
TrainSen	00010	 This place is huge for me!! It's like this whole library is the size of my town.
TrainSen	00010	 All the people in it too.
TrainSen	00010	 My town is tiny and there are a thousand people here!!! It's so crazy to come from a town that the population is the size of a full library! That's tiny compared to this place!  Along with all this walking in and out, I've never seen so many people get together at once and if I have, it was at my 600 student high school!! These 600 students were all four grades put together!  That makes me laugh because I feel like an ant here!! But that's ok.
TrainSen	00010	 I will grow to be a big UT Longhorn!! Woo! Hoo!!  So,  I miss my little sister.
TrainSen	00010	 She's 9 years old and I was like her second mommy.
TrainSen	00010	 My older sister attends UT and she's been here for a while now! Back at home, It was only both my parents and my little sister and I !  When my parents went out I would have to take care of her and I practically did that all nine years of her life.
TrainSen	00010	 practically!!! haahhahaha!! We all went out a lot so we left her with my grandmother or my aunt at times!! She was who I always came home to to play with!! She always wanted me to play with her and most of the time I did!! I would try to take her to all of my games in sports and all of my track meets!  She really loved to see me play!! She always wanted to play with my team and after every game .
TrainSen	00010	 ""Cyndi, When I grow up, I'm going to play Basketball too, or volleyball and I'm also going to run track and throw the discus.
TrainSen	00010	 Just like you!"" Awwww.
TrainSen	00010	 My baby wants to be just like me!! I think she's the one I miss the most because I grew up with her and she grew up with me!! WoW! She's so big now!! I can still remember when she was just a little baby!! Awww.
TrainSen	00010	 my little baby! Oh yeah.
TrainSen	00010	 and her name is Joyce Lynn just in case you wanted to know!  She's a very smart girl and I can't wait until she grows up!! She already knows what she wants to be.
TrainSen	10000	so yeah.
TrainSen	10000	 I finally get to the point where I feel like I have some sanity in my life, and back he comes.
TrainSen	10000	 why did I let him back into my life?  I went out last weekend and had the weekend from hell.
TrainSen	10000	 first the fire alarm, then the game (not too bad), then the car accident (thank God none of us were involved), and finally the other two ambulances in front of Halcyon.
TrainSen	10000	 why can't just go get a damn cup of tea without the world come crashing down on me (improper grammar, I kmow.
TrainSen	10000	 so is the punctuation for that matter).
TrainSen	10000	 so anyway, back to jason.
TrainSen	10000	 the bane of my existence and the one thing I cannot escape.
TrainSen	10000	 last night I decide to try an dangerous tactic and back him into a corner just to see what he'd do.
TrainSen	10000	 (probably should have left that up to the professionals - namely advisor jes who did it with me to get me to pick a concentration, classics or middle east.
TrainSen	10000	 )  found out it doesn't work as well with relationships - esp.
TrainSen	10000	 with a guy who has taken over a year to make up his mind and still hasn't really decided anything.
TrainSen	10000	 talk about making me feel completely worthless.
TrainSen	10000	 so I say, ""you're still a kid.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  ""I know.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  ""so grow up, jason.
TrainSen	10000	 be a man.
TrainSen	10000	 make a goddamn decision.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  ""I can't be with you.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  why does he always run?  my brother did the same thing.
TrainSen	10000	 what is it about men that when faced with fight of flight emotionally, they ALWAYS run?  so unwittingly I cornered myself as well.
TrainSen	10000	 I realized I can't let this man go, no matter how bad he is for me.
TrainSen	10000	 I will continually put myself at his mercy, despite the fact that HE was the one who left me this summer.
TrainSen	10000	 why do I make it so easy for him to come back.
TrainSen	10000	 is a little bit of fear a healthy thing?  he's not afraid to lose me at all!  because he KNOWS that I'll never go anywhere.
TrainSen	10000	 too bad the fool didn't KNOW that I loved him as much as I did.
TrainSen	10000	 now how do I get that back?  I was crying on the windowsill.
TrainSen	10000	 just one more part of the apartment to be initiated into my life with tears.
TrainSen	10000	 I was hoping the sill would have been initiated in other ways.
TrainSen	10000	 he promised to come visit me.
TrainSen	10000	 this coming weekend was shot to hell thanks to ET.
TrainSen	10000	 second time that bastard has screwed up my life.
TrainSen	10000	 so I make him promise me the weekend after.
TrainSen	10000	 only thing is that I had plans to celebrate my birthday with my friends that weekend.
TrainSen	10000	 football game + club = fun night.
TrainSen	10000	 now he's coming, hopefully.
TrainSen	10000	 but yet more plans put aside for him.
TrainSen	10000	 he would say, ""but I never asked you to do that,"" or, ""you're the one that wants me to come.
TrainSen	10000	 ""  why doesn't he get that I hate living like this, and it's HIS torture that makes me have to put my life aside?  so now what do I do?  I call him all day, playing phone tag, hating the hell I'm in.
TrainSen	10000	 but I keep my composure.
TrainSen	10000	 if anything I've learned in this last year of hell it's how to keep my composure.
TrainSen	10000	 not enitirely sure what good that does me.
TrainSen	10000	 damn this keyboard is spongy.
TrainSen	10000	 wish it had that new full size one that has flat keys like a laptop.
TrainSen	10000	 should make it much easier on the CTS.
TrainSen	10000	 so what was I thinking?  oh yeah, phone tag.
TrainSen	10000	 I finally get to talk to him while I'm in the bathroom (wow does that gross him out) and I ask him if we can just pretend last night didn't happen.
TrainSen	10000	 and he tells me I'm paranoid.
TrainSen	10000	 fool, you told me you couln't be with me and I'm not supposed to be paranoid?  WTF?!  geez, I write a lot in 15 mins.
TrainSen	10000	 this picture above the computer in the lab is.
TrainSen	10000	 interesting, not really pretty.
TrainSen	10000	 poor taste in art these people.
TrainSen	10000	 so then he starts falling asleep, as ususal, and the conversation dies.
TrainSen	10000	 and each time I try to resurrect the thing to achieve some sort of closure, I feel like part of me dies too.
TrainSen	10000	 how many buckets my tears would fill over this past year I could not count.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm so tired of crying.
TrainSen	10000	 it's frightening that sometimes it's the only thing that makes anything better.
TrainSen	10000	 and even more scary that I cry just to get a response out of him because he DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING!!!  the silence is pure torture and he must know it.
TrainSen	10000	 but nothing ever changes.
TrainSen	10000	 do I sound like I have abused spouse syndrome?  emotionally abused.
TrainSen	10000	 tortured.
TrainSen	10000	 dead.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder what these girls would think if they read over my shoulder.
TrainSen	10000	 what would sameera say/do if she knew I was putting myself through hell again for this man?  time almost up.
TrainSen	10000	 thanks for the opportunity for the release.
TrainSen	10000	 5 4 3 2 1 done.
TrainSen	10000	I am watching t.
TrainSen	10000	 v.
TrainSen	10000	 and waiting for my friends to get here from out of town.
TrainSen	10000	 which I don't even know if they are going to show up because they are taking a really long time.
TrainSen	10000	 I like that movie 50 first dates.
TrainSen	10000	 I said that because I'm watching t.
TrainSen	10000	 v.
TrainSen	10000	 oh I already said that.
TrainSen	10000	 well any way I am just so bored trying to finish my homework before tommorow just so I won't have a lot to do during the week.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home also, but he'll be here on friday.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish he wasn't in san antonio right now.
TrainSen	10000	 it always seems like gets down when he visits san antonio.
TrainSen	10000	 and now he's at the hospital because his cousin stopped breathing.
TrainSen	10000	 I pray to God that she's.
TrainSen	10000	 I had one of those pop ups come up because I am on my slow, old computer.
TrainSen	10000	 I watching the monk.
TrainSen	10000	 I love the monk because it's mysteries.
TrainSen	10000	 and the monk always has some cool way to figure out the murders.
TrainSen	10000	 it's a marathon and I'm starting to get tired of watching it.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope that venus williams wins in her tennis match today.
TrainSen	10000	 that will shut some of those people that are saying rude things about her father up.
TrainSen	10000	 I like both of the sisters but venus hasn't won in a long time so I think it's her turn to take the crown.
TrainSen	10000	 I am almost half way through this writing assignment.
TrainSen	10000	 I keep reminding myself that I need to take a look at the experiments so I can sign up for them.
TrainSen	10000	 I forget how many hours I need.
TrainSen	10000	 Oh I just looked at the paper, it says 5 hours.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know what to write because I haven't been involved in a lot of interesting activities.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish my friends lived in austin then I wouldn't have to rely so much on seeing derrick.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope this isn't the same monk, it is so I need to change the channel.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't know what to watch we got this digital cable but it repeats the channels over and over.
TrainSen	10000	 Derrick is going to have to give them a call and let them know that.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope that wasn't intented.
TrainSen	10000	 man, there is nothing to watch on labor day.
TrainSen	10000	 I hope I got my class code right because I didn't write it down.
TrainSen	10000	 that wasn't very smart.
TrainSen	10000	 now I'm watching the source awards from two years ago on BET.
TrainSen	10000	 I got to find something a little better to watch.
TrainSen	10000	 I just changed to what not to wear.
TrainSen	10000	 I think this show is nice because it makes people over to look so nice.
TrainSen	10000	 that would be nice in a way if someone did that to me, but then I would be affended that people don't like the way I dress.
TrainSen	10000	 I have always wanted to be a model, but as they say it takes money to make money.
TrainSen	10000	 I have this filling that I might win the lottery but I guess everyone has that feeling.
TrainSen	10000	 I love to talk about what I would do if I won the lottery.
TrainSen	10000	 I would certainly give my mother a good sum of money and also my step dad.
TrainSen	10000	 I would give my father enough so that he could retire from the army and not have to work anymore.
TrainSen	00100	      I am watching an italian movie called ""respiro"" it basically about a crazy woman in a little town in italy.
TrainSen	00100	 it made me wonder what etitles someone to call another human crazy or even a lunatic.
TrainSen	00100	 also what emotions should be those o someone different.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel that maybe those whact in their own way are freer than those supressed bya society.
TrainSen	00100	 why do we have to follow the same pattern as everyone else.
TrainSen	00100	 care about politics.
TrainSen	00100	 informed of what happens inthe world.
TrainSen	00100	 speak two or more languages and communicate to each other and try to conprehed different cultures.
TrainSen	00100	 wonder if the gobalization will end in making sa homogeneoussociety.
TrainSen	00100	 will we everget to that point were we can finally agree taht we are the same.
TrainSen	00100	 or is it gona be like the constant fighting in the middle east.
TrainSen	00100	 were ina  documentary I HBO a little palestinian boy stronly beleived that there would never be peace in his land.
TrainSen	00100	 How can a little boy be so certain.
TrainSen	00100	 think is incredible because I am not even certain about what I am even writting or thinking here.
TrainSen	00100	 are soe beliefs so strong that they can't be stopped.
TrainSen	00100	 were do they come from.
TrainSen	00100	 if tehy are all in our minds is there a way to make them change thugh science.
TrainSen	00100	 could we washed brains in the search for peace.
TrainSen	00100	 probably not.
TrainSen	00100	 I just feel such an espectator in a geat movie and not doing anything.
TrainSen	00100	 I also wonder if ill ver be recognized at some point.
TrainSen	00100	 or may ill just go unnoticed.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess I already understood that you meet different peope at different times and ou will always oose contact with them and the proess starts again.
TrainSen	00100	 so should I try o make the greatest effort in becomingtses peoples fiends or just use them for he time being and move on.
TrainSen	00100	 my computer doesn't work and my roommates keyboard is old and the buttons get stuck.
TrainSen	00100	 whoever reads this assignment si going to think I have horible spelling.
TrainSen	00100	 should I care?? I care about the assignent because it counts twards my grade, but shoudl I care about the opinion in the graders head apart from them just rading it.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know.
TrainSen	00100	 What to write.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess the thought taht have been in my head the most recently.
TrainSen	00100	 welll my best friends mom is dying of cancer.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know how o deal with te situation wha do you tell a friend.
TrainSen	00100	 It made me woder what to do with my tme because I can not even imagine what would it feel like that your time si runing out.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not going to saysomething like live evryday to he fullest and all that hallmark stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 but I do wonder what you think at night knowing you going to die.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't think I would be scared of dying, but if not doing everything I wnated to do in one life time.
TrainSen	00100	 Also believe that its incredible how many thoughts g on in our heads I could never write the all.
TrainSen	00100	 it will take a life time.
TrainSen	00100	     Stream on consciousness, this is something I have done before, when I was writing my diary, I though it'd be a cool idea, I wrote down a lot of stuff, some having to do with music, some having to do with my boyfriend.
TrainSen	00100	 He's a good guy, I miss him sometimes, well I do but I don't- it's not really an active missing, it's a passive missing, like I know I do somehwhere in my heart, but it doesn't hurt or anything I wonder what that could mean? everyone always asks me how long we'll last, and even though I'm not sure, I guess well last a long time, I mean its already been a year, which really doesn't seems so long anymore, only a few weeks maybe, until I really think about it.
TrainSen	00100	 then its much longer.
TrainSen	00100	 even though it all doesn't add up at first- it makes sense somhow.
TrainSen	00100	 you know? it all makes sense when you look back at it all.
TrainSen	00100	 I tend to think in really long streams and then my mind pauses, as if to switch subjects, not really to- well actually sometimes, to reflect on it- but I always inevitably move on, I wonder if that's what veryone's like.
TrainSen	00100	 if they all reflect on their thoughts like I do, then move on.
TrainSen	00100	 or if they thing continuosly only shifting smoothly from one thought to the next.
TrainSen	00100	 there has to be someone like that, somewhere.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe in china or some other country, but some where.
TrainSen	00100	 I refuse to think that people all think the same, not only because people are inherently different but because even if 99% of us wer the same, there would have to be at least one person who's not.
TrainSen	00100	 That's just the way I think.
TrainSen	00100	 Ellipses are fun, they provide space, and soetimes a depth that no other literary device can reach.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not sure if depth is the right word of if tis truly a literary device, but ellipses are (thoughts search for word) something that people use.
TrainSen	00100	 Woah, a mental stumble in words, I wonder how oftne I do that? I don't think I realize when taht happens, that reminds me of foreign languages- I like foreign languages.
TrainSen	00100	 rightnow I'm taking dutch- but spanish is the one I'm most versed in.
TrainSen	00100	 I think in spanish sometimes, its kind of fun, and I have always found it interesting that someone could actually think in another language then they'er own.
TrainSen	00100	 I used to think when I was a little kid that that would be impossible- then I though itd be incredible, now that I can do taht it just seems like fun, I like it, it feels.
TrainSen	00100	 Comforting somehow.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm not sure why.
TrainSen	00100	 it must be because my goal is to be fluent in as many languages as possible- though I'll probably do only four or five- someone in my class has a father that knows seven.
TrainSen	00100	 I find hat amazing, it's simply amazing what the mind is capable of.
TrainSen	00100	 Medicine is fascinationg to me, not just the cure type, but the physiological aspect of the human boday, and the relation so the psychological part of the human body, has always fascinated me, even when I was younger.
TrainSen	00100	 I suppose I've always had a fascination with biology and the like and that is what has led me to this point in my life.
TrainSen	00100	 its like my whole life up to this point has guided me to this exact path, and in a way, to this exact moment in time.
TrainSen	00100	 perhaps only to point me in another direction.
TrainSen	00100	 (looks up at light) not all the lights in this library are lit, I wonder why.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe its because it would be too bright, or maybe because the sun is still out, or maybe some of them burnt out.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder if there's a pattern.
TrainSen	00100	 (searches for pattern) no, there doesn't appear to be a pattern.
TrainSen	00100	 not lit.
TrainSen	00100	 lit lit lit lit lit lit not lit not lit lit all the way down the row, lit lit lit lit partially lit not lit lit lit lit lit all the way down the row (lost her place) ah well.
TrainSen	00100	 worth a shot.
TrainSen	00100	 I search for patterns in things a lot- very scientific like.
TrainSen	00100	 that one police officer told me I sounded like a doctor.
TrainSen	00100	 he asked me what I was going to ut to be and I said I was going to major in biology and become a doctor and he said ""You sound like a doctor, in the way you tlak"" I though that was kind of weird at first, but very logical.
TrainSen	00100	 I am analytical by nature and tend to use larger words than many people, though they are not always right in my head- when I say them they come out right, and not only that but I love biology, and finding out what makes us tick, and wen I'm in an argument I try to see all the sides- and to see what's underneath it all.
TrainSen	00100	 for instance I try to see what the ohr person is saying and why.
TrainSen	00100	 what makes them say that.
TrainSen	00100	 why they say it the way they do- I'm going to like this class- I like psychology.
TrainSen	00100	 psych= mind.
TrainSen	00100	 ology= the study of.
TrainSen	00100	 I was in medical terminology.
TrainSen	00100	 actually the class was called health science tech, but the main part was about medical terminology and working in the clinical setting, I worked at the hospital but instead of money I got grades, particiapation grades reall.
TrainSen	00100	 it was fun, even the parts most would consider gross.
TrainSen	00100	 I enjoyed it- but I don't think I want to be one of thos doctors tthat work in the hospital.
TrainSen	00100	 I think my typingg is louder than everyone else in this library, the keys aren't the easiest to push.
TrainSen	00100	 they stick a little, on some letters more than others.
TrainSen	00100	 they're like keyboard keys that get stuck because you were careless and spilled soda on them, but a little looser.
TrainSen	00100	 they're not quite tahat stick at all.
TrainSen	00100	 but still they seem so loud.
TrainSen	00100	 The guy outside in orange is drinking coffee- I like orange soda.
TrainSen	00100	 its my favorite color and soda, good stuff.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder how much time people spend observing things outside their little bubble.
TrainSen	00100	 if people had a bubble of consciousnes, it would be their immediate surroundings.
TrainSen	00100	 just basically what they can touch, or what they can comfortably read.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder how many people ake time to see beyond that and what they're like.
TrainSen	00100	 what type f people they are, if people really do have type.
TrainSen	00100	 basically, what they're like inside.
TrainSen	00100	 ar they analytical, whimsical, forward thinking? are they lacadaisical? what are they like? am I really one of them? I kind of think I might be or maybe one that is in between that and the other.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe I'm right in the middle of two extremes like fire and ice, heaven and hell, earth and water.
TrainSen	00100	     NFL kickoff tonight.
TrainSen	00100	 should be fun to watch.
TrainSen	00100	 Going to get depressed watching them play.
TrainSen	00100	 actually probably not, but I wish I could play ball ! I played highschool football, and actually did Div,.
TrainSen	00100	 III equivalent in Erope.
TrainSen	00100	 that was fun.
TrainSen	00100	 This assignment is too long should be 10 minutes, not 20.
TrainSen	00100	 I read a book that was stram off consciensness (did I spell that right?).
TrainSen	00100	 Cassandra, by Christal wolf.
TrainSen	00100	 I was an IB book.
TrainSen	00100	 it ought to be fun going back to norway this winter for xmas.
TrainSen	00100	 can't wait to see my parents and sis.
TrainSen	00100	 and dog.
TrainSen	00100	 coach will send me a CD with all our game footage from last season.
TrainSen	00100	 Go domers.
TrainSen	00100	 He said I could play whenever I was in norway.
TrainSen	00100	 awesome.
TrainSen	00100	 I was a badass corner back.
TrainSen	00100	 if I was 40lbs heavier (muscle) and faster I could play for UT.
TrainSen	00100	 It would be a frikkin dream come true.
TrainSen	00100	 that's one regret that I have in life.
TrainSen	00100	 maybe one of my only ones: that I will forever just be a varsity highschool ball players.
TrainSen	00100	 or maybe not its not that big a deal I guess.
TrainSen	00100	 can't wait til I'm flyin in the US air force! greatest country ever!! this assignmentt is getting old.
TrainSen	00100	 nnobody's going to read all of them anyway green mesquite bbq.
TrainSen	00100	 Mmm I don't really want to go, but I want the bbq plus I get to see rotc people but I actually don't really want to now I want to lay in bed and watch tv play ta.
TrainSen	10000	Ok so I just got back from a four hour study hour thing at the ZTA house.
TrainSen	10000	 WOW the most pointless thing ever.
TrainSen	10000	 I read maybe 10 pages.
TrainSen	10000	 How am I supposed to study with 50 other girls there in the room? You don't have that much space and of course you want to talk about what happened last night and who ended up where, and blahblahblah.
TrainSen	10000	 I know they have good intentions in making us do this, but 4 hours at one time is waaay too long to try to study.
TrainSen	10000	 No one really got anything done.
TrainSen	10000	 But hey it was fun- I got to bond more with my sorority sisters! Speaking of sorority stuff, I love it.
TrainSen	10000	 At first, I was afraid I wouldn't like it, or that the girls wouldn't like me, but I Couldn't be having more fun.
TrainSen	10000	 I have more friends than I thought I would have going into college, and they're real friends, too, not friends you ""pay for"" with sorority fees.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm listening to music right now, and recently (as in the past couple of months) I've gotten more and more into music.
TrainSen	10000	 I've always loved music, but ever since I dated a great guy who is a complete music person I've liked it even more.
TrainSen	10000	 Today kyle and I (my aggie ex-boyfriend) were joking about how pathetic we are for missing eachother so much.
TrainSen	10000	 it was funny.
TrainSen	10000	 we knew going into it at the beginning of the summer that we were going to break up when we went off to college because, of course, it wouldn't work.
TrainSen	10000	 But now that we're all settled in, we still miss eachother.
TrainSen	10000	 It got really serious really fast.
TrainSen	10000	 it was unbelievably random.
TrainSen	10000	 We never thought we would hook-up, but it happened and it was awesome.
TrainSen	10000	 I hate to say it because I'm so young and I hate it when people say things like that, but I could quite possibly see myself with him after college- like permanently.
TrainSen	10000	 That's so weird.
TrainSen	10000	 Well, sincewe did break up, we are allowed to hang out with other people (date-wise) but neither of us really wanted to.
TrainSen	10000	 Last week I met this really cool guy from the Woodlands-he's an ATO pledge.
TrainSen	10000	 I've gone to a couple parties with him as his date and I kind of have a crush on him.
TrainSen	10000	 It's exciting, but at the same time, I'm far from being over Kyle.
TrainSen	10000	 The whole point of not being together was that we could go out and have fun without being tied down, but I still feel bad about it.
TrainSen	10000	 I have constantly had this entire ""soap opera"" on my mind for the last week- nonstop.
TrainSen	10000	 The cool thing about being in a relationship is that you have that stability- you never have to wonder if he likes you, or if he's going to call and all that.
TrainSen	10000	 With a new guy it's always like I wonder if he likes me and why didn't he call?-worrying.
TrainSen	10000	 It's fun, don't' get me wrong, but it kind of puts ur confidence in check.
TrainSen	10000	 I've recently gotten into Maroon 5 again.
TrainSen	10000	 I used to love them, but working at Hollister and hearing the entire CD all the time made me hate it.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't work at Hollister anymore, so I havent heard Maroon 5 in awhile, and now I love them again.
TrainSen	01000	  When I got online tonight I was prompted with an instant message from an unknown person.
TrainSen	01000	 The person, aka MuffinCheeseqn, asked me if they remembered me from last night.
TrainSen	01000	 Last night! Last night I was with Sarah, my roomie, watching Shrek! I was totally freaking out.
TrainSen	01000	 I was telling Sarah that I had a stalker! This ""MuffinCheeseqn"" kept telling me that they were beginging to get to know me better so they wanted me to keep talking to them.
TrainSen	01000	 Talk about freaky! Well finally a message box came up stating that it was one of my friends that had played a joke on me.
TrainSen	01000	 What a friend! It ended up being my roomie's cousin! 'Lil punk! Anyhoo, that made my night though.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been over at my friend Danny's dorm working on a computer science program that is due tomorrow.
TrainSen	01000	 I've been there since 5! I don't like the first program and I'm majoring in CS! What was I thinking! They should have a major in learning the ABCs! Oh man its only been 5 minutes.
TrainSen	01000	 Man, I think Sarah needs to be quiet so I can concentrate on this writing assignment! lol! So Sarah has some pretty cute guys in her classes! I've seen some although she has failed to introduce me to them! OO I just remembered that I need to finish the pre-screening for the experiment requirements cause I really don't want to write a five page paper! I'm not very good at writing papers.
TrainSen	01000	 Obviously! I'm not very good at calculus either.
TrainSen	01000	 Although, today I actually understood something in my calculus discussion class! I probably will have trouble applying it to my homework problems though.
TrainSen	01000	 Oh my gosh.
TrainSen	01000	 I have a calculus midterm on FRIDAY! well next Friday.
TrainSen	01000	 I have to do some major studying this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 This weekend my parents will be out of town.
TrainSen	01000	 It will be the last time my parents can take a vacation for a year.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom just got a new job! Yeah for my mom! She's been really therefore leaving my mom was out of a job.
TrainSen	01000	 So we were living off of my dad's salary which isn't enough to pay all the bills.
TrainSen	01000	 Thankfully my parents savings saved up but still taking a little every month will eventually end in 0.
TrainSen	01000	 My mom looked for a job for almost 3 months before she just got hired last week.
TrainSen	01000	 She doesn't have a college degree so that made it hard for her to find a job.
TrainSen	01000	 That's why she wants me to get an education.
TrainSen	01000	 She doesn't want me to.
TrainSen	01000	 Sarah needs to shut up! She just walked into my room.
TrainSen	01000	 OH MY GOSH she's singing the Fresh Prince of Bel Air Song! lol She just read what I wrote.
TrainSen	01000	 OH MY GOSH now she's playing her mello.
TrainSen	01000	 She's in the longhorn band.
TrainSen	01000	 She's a big band nerd.
TrainSen	01000	 I was once a band nerd.
TrainSen	01000	 I played the sax! Wow I have like two minutes left! Well right now I'm feeling.
TrainSen	00100	     The speakers that are connected to my computer are extremely cheap.
TrainSen	00100	 I only purchased them because there was a $15 mail-in rebate with them.
TrainSen	00100	 It would be really nice to have a new computer, this one is old and outdated and the internet connection is really slow.
TrainSen	00100	 I am tired of always having to listen to my brother and his girlfriend bicker and yell at each other, they are like two little kids every waking hour I'm with them they are constantly harassing each other.
TrainSen	00100	 My computer monitor is really small.
TrainSen	00100	 It makes looking at my screen for extended periods of time like this hurt my eyes.
TrainSen	00100	 College life is really not what I expected.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm constantly feeling homesick and want to go back to Houston.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess I just need to get acclimated to Austin and college life once I do I'm sure I will enjoy it very much but until then I will attempt to go back to Houston as much as possible.
TrainSen	00100	 Luckily a lot of my friends also attend UT, they are definitely making the transition more bearable.
TrainSen	00100	 Every one of my classes has over 100 people in them.
TrainSen	00100	 This is a big change from my 20 people honors classes in high school.
TrainSen	00100	 It doesn't really allow me to make relationships with my professors.
TrainSen	00100	 Raquetball was really fun.
TrainSen	00100	 I ran smack into the wall with my shoulder and it still hurts but its a good pain one of those pains that reminds you that you accomplished something fun and physically strenuous.
TrainSen	00100	 Yeah I don't think I spelled that word correctly.
TrainSen	00100	 I'll have to look it up in the dictionary when I am done.
TrainSen	00100	 Is this assignment done yet? No still 13 and a half minutes to go.
TrainSen	00100	 This is the first time I've ever written a stream of consciousness.
TrainSen	00100	 I know there is some famous novel or documentary our there where there is like a 17 page stream of consciousness containing only a single sentence.
TrainSen	00100	 I think its title has the world Ullyses or it is written by a Ullyses or something.
TrainSen	00100	 I know this because my father appraised me of it.
TrainSen	00100	 Just useless trivia I guess.
TrainSen	00100	 I enjoy watching trivia games on TV, mainly stuff like Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Jeopardy.
TrainSen	00100	 But maybe that's just because normally there isn't anything else on.
TrainSen	00100	 The World Series of Poker is enjoyable to watch as well.
TrainSen	00100	 I was initially really sceptical about writing this stream of consciousness because I didn't really know how it would turn out or how easy it would be to write, but now that I'm half way through it things are just sort appearing on the page.
TrainSen	00100	 Definitely not what I expected.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to say this is the most interesting writing assignment I think I have ever had.
TrainSen	00100	 Whew only 8 minutes to go.
TrainSen	00100	 The printer next to me is running out of ink, which means it will have to be replaced pretty soon which means more money out of my pocket.
TrainSen	00100	 You have to be thrifty in college that's for sure.
TrainSen	00100	 My budget is $500 a month and this month alone I have already spent over 800.
TrainSen	00100	 I sure am glad that I received financial aid to make the burden of paying for college easier on my parents.
TrainSen	00100	 They were sure proud of me when I told them about the scholarships I received.
TrainSen	00100	 It felt good to make them proud.
TrainSen	00100	 My brother is smart and does extremely well in school, I hope I can live up to my parents standards and continue to do well educationally in college.
TrainSen	00100	 College sure is much different from high school.
TrainSen	00100	 A lot more studying and my studying skills aren't nearly up to par considering I almost never did it high school.
TrainSen	00100	 Now I know I need to study to do well in school so I am, but it just takes me forever to outline a chapter.
TrainSen	00100	 A lot longer than it seems like it really should.
TrainSen	00100	 I guess maybe I'm a little bit too stressed out about college.
TrainSen	00100	 I'm sure that once I get used to it, it will be one of the best experiences of my life.
TrainSen	00100	 But until then, it's still hell.
TrainSen	00100	 My friends are in the living room, I told them before I started writing this not to disturb me for 30 minutes, but who knows if they will obey me.
TrainSen	00100	 My one friend John loves to just barge into my room.
TrainSen	00100	 I played raquetball with John and Joseph.
TrainSen	00100	 I suck at raquetball but hey it's only my 3rd or 4th time to play it.
TrainSen	00100	 None of us are really are that good.
TrainSen	00100	 The lie detector test in Psychology class last time was cool.
TrainSen	00100	 My hands normally get really sweaty so I'm sure I would have sent that sweat-o-meter off the charts, I wonder why my hands are sweaty a lot.
TrainSen	00010	     Well I guess I will just write about my college life or what has been of it so far.
TrainSen	00010	 Well I guess the bad news for today was that I think I failed my first Astronomy Quiz maybe I should of studied more maybe I should have paid more attention in class who knows?? But hey they drop the lowest quiz grade.
TrainSen	00010	 Life has been very stressful lately with starting a new job and just trying to make time for everything its almost impossilbe.
TrainSen	00010	 I mean there is just so much to do read for classes, study, but still have time to hang out with your friends.
TrainSen	00010	 At the time the people I am most hanging out with are those from my home town.
TrainSen	00010	 Good old Del Rio Texas the land of amistad I don't know if I was suppose to make a lot of new friends but for the moment they are the one I have most been hanging out with I mean I have grown up with them and they know me !  I guess I just feel comfortable around them because we have a lot of things in common and besides when ever I need I ride home they are there.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate is also from Del Rio the town where everyone knows everyone most of my family lives there and well looking back a lot of high school drama goes on.
TrainSen	00010	 Everyone in High School always has something to say about everyone else I mean its terrible its hard to believe I was in all that drama as well.
TrainSen	00010	 Yeah well my roommate is my best friend and well you know living together is much more diffrent than just seeing each other everyday at school but hey we are hanging in there no major fights or anything, you learn to adapt.
TrainSen	00010	 Since she doesn't have as much reading to do as I do I just learn to go to the Study Lounge and well I don't mind all that much it makes me study since there is nothing else to do there.
TrainSen	00010	 But well back to my life in college.
TrainSen	00010	 I started my job yesterday and its lots of fun just because you don't really do much and well you get paid for it.
TrainSen	00010	 Its like the people in the office are looking for things to make me do so today I was shreding paper.
TrainSen	00010	 Then well I was suppose to go to this free pizza and bowling for the TIP.
TrainSen	00010	 This program I'm in that is suppose to create a small school enviroment in this big school and well when me and my friend Monica showed up they had eaten all the food so well that went that idea, we just ended up eating at Wendy's.
TrainSen	00010	 Its funny how you seem to cling on to those you know rather than meet new people I mean me and Monice didn't quite get along in High School but now its just kind of we put up with each other just to have someone there she has 2 classes with me and well none of my other friends yeah the phone rang so I lost my train of thought and well now my roommate came in.
TrainSen	00010	 So yeah where was I yeah about people from my town.
TrainSen	00010	 I miss my parents and well I guess the town I little bit.
TrainSen	00010	 When I was there it was fun the first couple of 15 years and then you get into high school and well pretty much all you want to do is leave there is only so much you can do and well crossing the border and getting drunk it not on my top list of great things to do like it was some of my fellow classmates.
TrainSen	00010	 But my parents are very special people to me and so is my boyfriend, I don't know they always seem to understand me no matter what mood I may be in or anything like that, I guess we all turn into terrible people sometimes, but not on purpose.
TrainSen	00010	 My mom is like the most loving person and well so is my dad I have just always considered myself to be lucky to have such great people like them as my parents so understanding and just giving.
TrainSen	00010	 Giving to other people giving of advice and well just anything they have to give.
TrainSen	00010	 The time has gone pretty fast in this thing at first I thought it would go by slow but no it has gone pretty fast.
TrainSen	00010	 And so to continue with my day I walked back to my dorm alone from the Union and well sometimes its good to be alone and well the school looks so much more peaceful when there are not a lot of people trying to get to class and well the way back from somewhere is always so much faster and shorter than when you are walking to get on time and you just get frustrated because the sidewalk just gets longer.
TrainSen	00001	     Yaaaaay.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm doing psychology things.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm really tired.
TrainSen	00001	 And I wish I didn't' have to study so that I could go to sleep.
TrainSen	00001	 I also wish I could type faster.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm glad I'm here.
TrainSen	00001	 Because being almost anywhere is better than being in Baytown.
TrainSen	00001	 Except for being in Houston.
TrainSen	00001	 Houston is all concrete and construction.
TrainSen	00001	 But UT has squirrels.
TrainSen	00001	 And lots of them.
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 What am I going to say in the whole 20 mins.
TrainSen	00001	 I have to say anything I want? .
TrainSen	00001	 Will people actually read this?.
TrainSen	00001	 I guess I don't care if they do.
TrainSen	00001	 Because I'm the type of person that thinks it's pointless to write for my own enjoyment.
TrainSen	00001	 I get enjoyment out of other people reading what I write and then them enjoying it.
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 Hmm.
TrainSen	00001	 I miss my boyfriend.
TrainSen	00001	 Even tho he made me ANGRY last nite.
TrainSen	00001	 He's still a nice and good boyfriend.
TrainSen	00001	 On another totally random note.
TrainSen	00001	 I've got this pimple on my face.
TrainSen	00001	 Hahaha.
TrainSen	00001	 It hurts! And it bothers me too! I want it to disappear! Not that it makes me look bad.
TrainSen	00001	 I actually think it makes me look somewhat cute! hahah.
TrainSen	00001	 That's kind of weird.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 I wish I had a memory card for my playstation so I can finish Final Fantasy 8.
TrainSen	00001	 At this rate.
TrainSen	00001	 It'll take me YEARS to finish it.
TrainSen	00001	 But maybe this is for the better.
TrainSen	00001	 So I can study instead of play, because I would definitely be playing that and Metal Gear Solid.
TrainSen	00001	 But.
TrainSen	00001	 Only on weekends.
TrainSen	00001	 Hahaha.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm a girl that plays video games.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm weeeeeiiiiiirrrrd.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if I can get that job at the LanCave.
TrainSen	00001	 I would be EVER SO HAAAAAPPPYYY.
TrainSen	00001	 That would be awesome.
TrainSen	00001	 It doesn't seem hard at all.
TrainSen	00001	 just like the same stuff I did at eb but instead of renting people games I sold it to them.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't miss eb at all.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if Julia left yet.
TrainSen	00001	 That place is the devil.
TrainSen	00001	 And video games are the spawn of the devil.
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder what Marky is doing over at UofH.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope he's having fun and he's not regretting his decision to go to UofH instead of UT.
TrainSen	00001	 yah.
TrainSen	00001	 We used to be big UT heads.
TrainSen	00001	 Then he changed his mind and I changed my mind.
TrainSen	00001	 And then I changed my mind again.
TrainSen	00001	 And the I changed my mind back again to UT and now here I am.
TrainSen	00001	 Woot woot go me.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope there's free therapy after this writing exercise.
TrainSen	00001	 blaaaaaaah.
TrainSen	00001	 I haven't met very many people that are into stuff that I'm into.
TrainSen	00001	 Except for Maryam.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait to meet some other dorky kids that are into videogames and Japanese and cute fashion stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 I want to go to Anime Club on Friday.
TrainSen	00001	 But I will be going all alone because I""m sure that Ashley will not come with me.
TrainSen	00001	 But Maryam might! I totally forgot.
TrainSen	00001	 I will call and ask her.
TrainSen	00001	 But that means that I have to give up Wushu practice.
TrainSen	00001	 Maaan.
TrainSen	00001	 I have such big dreams.
TrainSen	00001	 But I have no idea which ones to follow.
TrainSen	00001	 That gets frustrating.
TrainSen	00001	 Okay.
TrainSen	00001	 If I decide to give up Wushu.
TrainSen	00001	 Then maybe I can get into fencing.
TrainSen	00001	 or maybe even Kendo.
TrainSen	00001	 But wushu is so neeeeaaat! but I don't know if I even have the strength to do it.
TrainSen	00001	 it's crazy.
TrainSen	00001	 maybe I should not do and just try again next year.
TrainSen	00001	 No hard feelings, I hope.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't even know if I'll have money to pay for that.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I get ANY job on campus.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm.
TrainSen	00001	 just.
TrainSen	00001	 Bleh.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope I get to stop being so anti-social.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm not really anti-social.
TrainSen	00001	 just a bit shy and cautious about who I talk to.
TrainSen	00001	 I think that's a good thing.
TrainSen	00001	 However, it can be very lonely.
TrainSen	00001	 My wrists hurt.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if my brother is having fun at home.
TrainSen	00001	 probably not.
TrainSen	00001	 Lol.
TrainSen	00001	 He never seems to be having fun when he's alone.
TrainSen	00001	 Aww.
TrainSen	00001	 Now I feel bad for leaving him.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe he'll be encouraged to invite his friends over to hang out or something.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't want him to be all lonely like I was as a junior in high school.
TrainSen	00001	 .
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder if my older brother has decided to go to graduate school yet.
TrainSen	00001	 Or if he's really thinking about that invention thing.
TrainSen	00001	 Heh.
TrainSen	00001	 At least he's got his major and he's doing it in 4 YEARS.
TrainSen	00001	 go him.
TrainSen	00001	 He's my hero.
TrainSen	00001	 Hahaha.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm glad he kind of knows what he wants to do, because I sure don't.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm torn between wanting something that will be lucrative and people will really need, and doing something that I looooove to do with all my heart.
TrainSen	00001	 I've found, thru various high school experiences and the first year long relationship, that I can learn to love almost anything.
TrainSen	00001	 which is a bad thing.
TrainSen	00001	 I have no idea what I'm really good at and have no idea exactly how to find out.
TrainSen	00001	 I already feel like I'm running out of time right now as I sit here typing out a required assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 It's crazy.
TrainSen	00001	 And frustrating.
TrainSen	00001	 And I don't' want to try to do too many things at once, because that is what caused my uber-dramatic downfall my senior year.
TrainSen	00001	 Okay.
TrainSen	00001	 Maybe it wasn't a downfall.
TrainSen	00001	 But it did make me realize some stuff about being human that you would think I'd know already, having been a human for almost 19 years.
TrainSen	00001	 Silly me.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well.
TrainSen	00001	 It won't happen again here, because I'm not in Baytown and I'm away from people that drag me down.
TrainSen	00001	 I can choose who to interact with most times here, so that puts me in a position of power I rarely have.
TrainSen	00001	 Yaaay for college.
TrainSen	00001	 very glad I'm here and not in Baytown.
TrainSen	01000	I have so much work to do and it all seems to just pile up on me.
TrainSen	01000	 In highschool I think was so used to just doing things the nigh before and I knew I could get it on but now that I'm in college I can't be doing that stuff.
TrainSen	01000	 I had a weird dream when I took a nap after my 3:30 class.
TrainSen	01000	 I drempt that I was at my physic teachers wedding and I was in the third row I believe and the lady he was marrying who was a chemistry teacher was mad that me and my friend were there at the wedding.
TrainSen	01000	 The rings they were getting married with were being passed around and they both had big pearls on them.
TrainSen	01000	 Right before the ceremony began my physics teacher looked back and recognized he had two former students at his wedding [me and my friend] and he smiled and then the dream ended.
TrainSen	01000	 I kind of freaked out, I'm not sure why.
TrainSen	01000	 When I woke up I wanted to call my friend and tell her about the dream.
TrainSen	01000	 I didn't end up calling her.
TrainSen	01000	 After I had been awake for a while I started thinking about my Junior year in highschool [which is when I had my Physics teacher], he was a pretty good teacher, I really learned a lot that year.
TrainSen	01000	 My parents are coming up this weekend for the UT game, I get to see my little brother so I'm real excited for that.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss him a lot.
TrainSen	01000	 I just ate Wendy's a little while ago and I'm stuffed.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm exhausted, my mind and body are very tired.
TrainSen	01000	 Last night I fell asleep around 1:00 and that's the earliest I have fallen asleep since I've been here in Austin.
TrainSen	01000	 In between and after classes I find myself napping and I think that makes it worse because at night I can't sleep at all.
TrainSen	01000	 Me and my roommate really get along, I like that.
TrainSen	01000	 Okay I think I'm going brain dead, or maybe its because I'm tired.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm happy I'm getting this out of the way now rather than the day before, I know its not a big deal but still.
TrainSen	01000	 It helps to just finish these things a little earlier than expected.
TrainSen	01000	 I love Austin so much.
TrainSen	01000	 I miss my friends back at home but I don't miss the Valley, which is where I'm from, Edinburg to be exact.
TrainSen	01000	 It's' funny how things just fly by so fast, I wonder if college will fly by as fast as highschool did.
TrainSen	01000	 who knows! I feel overwhelemd, not just with reading and school work but with other things beside that.
TrainSen	01000	 My parents expect me to bring all A's and I guess that can be possible but come on, I don't think I'll get ALL A's through college.
TrainSen	01000	 I just want to do well enough to get into the graduate school I want to go too.
TrainSen	01000	 Another thing that's bothering me is the whole boy problem thing.
TrainSen	01000	 My boyfriend goes to UTSA and its not the long distance thing that is bothering me, it's the whole ""being tied down"" part.
TrainSen	01000	 There's so many people to meet here and I care about my boyfriend a lot but he messed up once and my ways of thinking about him and I have altered in a sense that could there really be someone else out there for me? My mom says I'll never know unless I ""venture out"" and see what could be out there.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I'm the type of person that is nice, maybe too nice.
TrainSen	01000	 Why do people take advantage of that? It's not fair.
TrainSen	01000	 I think I need to be a more stronger person when it comes to certain issues.
TrainSen	01000	 I guess these are just the typical girl problems.
TrainSen	01000	 It's funny how guys don't really care or think about things like that.
TrainSen	01000	 It's also funny how guys minds are so much different from girls and how their views are completely oppposite.
TrainSen	01000	 I really need to catch up with reading in Psychology, I think that's the only think I'm a little behind in, as far as reading.
TrainSen	01000	 I want to have a good semester and leave during the Christmas holidays knowing that I did my best as far as that semester was concerned.
TrainSen	01000	 Today in Astronomy we talked about the stars and how old they are and all that stuff and today when I was walking back from Wendy's, I couldn't help but look up at the moon and stars and then reflect back to my Astronomy class.
TrainSen	01000	 All that stuff is so cool.
TrainSen	01000	 I would LOVE to go to the moon that would be cool, but its one of those things I want to do but probably wouldn't do it if I could.
TrainSen	01000	 Well time is almost up and I enjoyed this a lot.
TrainSen	10000	     I just got done doing some homework for critical thinking and it is really late.
TrainSen	10000	 I am extremely tired and I wish I would have done this assignment earlier.
TrainSen	10000	 This is hard to write when I am so tired.
TrainSen	10000	 I should have not talked on the phone all night and done my work earlier, but I was such a good conversation.
TrainSen	10000	 Its funny how I always want to type about just nothing and now I can but it feels weird.
TrainSen	10000	 Anyway my conversation was about me going home this weekend.
TrainSen	10000	 I am going home because my uncle and his wife are down from North Carolina and my mom wants me to visit.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder how my cousins (my uncle that's downs kids) are doing.
TrainSen	10000	 One is my age and the other is two years older then me.
TrainSen	10000	 They both go to college but I'm not sure where.
TrainSen	10000	 I also have cousins that go to Texas State.
TrainSen	10000	 the other day I was thinking about calling one of them to see if she wanted to hang out since we are so close.
TrainSen	10000	 but I don't have her number.
TrainSen	10000	 I actually havent even talked to her in a year almost.
TrainSen	10000	 The last time I saw her was last thanksgiving.
TrainSen	10000	 We always eat thanksgiving dinner and my great aunts house.
TrainSen	10000	 Thinking about Thanksgiving is making me hungry for some green bean casarole.
TrainSen	10000	 My mom always makes that for Thanksgiving.
TrainSen	10000	 Its the best! So is fried okra.
TrainSen	10000	 I had that for dinner last night with some mashed potatoes at the Jester City Limits.
TrainSen	10000	 Jester City Limits has some good food but its very tiring and makes me feel like I eat to much, they should close earlier so I can't eat so much.
TrainSen	10000	 Running is very good.
TrainSen	10000	 I actually found the energy to go run today.
TrainSen	10000	 In high school I played soccer so I was in really good shape and ran a whole lot.
TrainSen	10000	 NOw I don't run at all and I need to.
TrainSen	10000	 Hopefully I can keep the routine of running all the time.
TrainSen	10000	 I was suppose to fun with my next door neighboor today but she went later.
TrainSen	10000	 Its funny I have lived her and she has been my neighbor for almost two weeks and yesterday was the first time I meet her.
TrainSen	10000	 She is a really cool girl.
TrainSen	10000	 We also meet two other girls from the same hallway.
TrainSen	10000	 I like meeting people.
TrainSen	10000	 I also meet a guy and me, him, and steph went to HEB how strange is that? then we went to go eat ice cream.
TrainSen	10000	 It was really good, really expensive, and really sweet.
TrainSen	10000	 The girl Steph works at an ice cream/ coffee shop that is hiring now.
TrainSen	10000	 I intend on putting in an application there soon.
TrainSen	10000	 Jobs are good, because you get money and I need lots of money so I can pay for my traffic ticket.
TrainSen	10000	 I speed everywhere and I get a ticket for running a red light.
TrainSen	10000	 how weird.
TrainSen	10000	 Yesterday my friend Ryan ran one too in front of a cop and he didn't get stopped.
TrainSen	10000	 o the luck I have.
TrainSen	10000	 I actually shouldn't complain about my luck, I know people with way worse luck then myself.
TrainSen	10000	 my little sisters friend megan has really bad luck.
TrainSen	10000	 Her dad died the other day.
TrainSen	10000	 It was really sad I wonder if she is doing any better? probably.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder what the  little sister is doing right now anyway.
TrainSen	10000	 I think she has a volleyball game tommorrow.
TrainSen	10000	 She is so cute she plays soccer just because I played.
TrainSen	10000	 I like how she looks up to me.
TrainSen	10000	 I wish I would have had a really old sister to look up to.
TrainSen	10000	 The closest thing to that where my cousins, who know live in alaska and montana.
TrainSen	10000	 Alaska would be a very crazy place to live.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm not sure I would want to live there even though my grandma says it was vvery very beautiful.
TrainSen	10000	 I am going to visit the old grandparents very soon.
TrainSen	10000	 I am flying there in two weekends.
TrainSen	10000	 I love flying, I have always dreamed of becoming a flight attendent one day.
TrainSen	10000	 I think that would be so fun to get to fly anywhere you want whenever for free.
TrainSen	10000	 I have always wanted to travel to different places and that would be the perfect oppurtunity.
TrainSen	10000	 I think I just spelt that word wrong.
TrainSen	10000	 o well I don't want to fix it.
TrainSen	10000	 So I see that this writing assignment is almost done.
TrainSen	10000	 that was the fastest 20 minuetes that have ever passed by I really want to go to sleep.
TrainSen	00100	     I wasn't expecting to get sick, but for some strange reason, I am sneezing,  coughing, and everything, it is crazy.
TrainSen	00100	 I am surprising myself lately though.
TrainSen	00100	 I  thought I would be much more home sick, but I don't know what I am missing, or if I  am missing anything at all.
TrainSen	00100	 I know I miss work, nothing made me more happy  really.
TrainSen	00100	 I know it wasn't fun all the time, but the people there made it worthwhile.
TrainSen	00100	 One in particular, no two in particular both for different reasons.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder when life is going to get easy.
TrainSen	00100	 I have been working hard since I was 16,  balancing a job, school, and trying to have a life.
TrainSen	00100	 Trying is the key word.
TrainSen	00100	 Sometimes I think I missed out in high school.
TrainSen	00100	 I was never the party type, only  because my parents wouldn't let me do anything, but I understand that they just  want the  best for me and don't want me to make the same mistakes that they  made.
TrainSen	00100	 What they don't understand is that, it is holding me back, because  eventually I may be in the same situation that they were in, and I won't know what  to do.
TrainSen	00100	 If I were to live anywhere in the world I would live in England, Surrey was  nice.
TrainSen	00100	 London is amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know what to say other than when I was there I  felt home, I loved it.
TrainSen	00100	 I surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather  than drive.
TrainSen	00100	 I enjoy taking drives though.
TrainSen	00100	 When I was at home, I enjoyed just  grabbing my keys and going.
TrainSen	00100	 I never had a particular destination, but my favorite  drives were at night, with the sun roof open, oh how it was so peaceful.
TrainSen	00100	 Kind of  like sailing.
TrainSen	00100	 Recently I joined the saililng club, it is nice, I wish there was more  wind my first sail, but even so it was still unbelievably calm, and placid.
TrainSen	00100	 It was so  nice, and made time go by so fast.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel so stupid about Endochine, I can't believe  we were just talking to them and didn't know it was then, awwww.
TrainSen	00100	 I feel so  stupid.
TrainSen	00100	 But then again there are a lot of times I feel stupid.
TrainSen	00100	 too many to list.
TrainSen	00100	 I can  not wait to go to the football game.
TrainSen	00100	 I miss band the most from high school, there  was nothing like marching into the stadium, especially this past year when the  crowd was actually happy that we were there.
TrainSen	00100	 I honestly never thought I would  see the day that that would happen.
TrainSen	00100	 Christina Aguilera's CD is very good, at least  most of it.
TrainSen	00100	 it is kind of sad at the same time.
TrainSen	00100	 It is surprising how cold it was this  morning, here I am dressed as if it were 98 degrees outside and it feels more like  70 unbelievable this is supposed to be Texas.
TrainSen	00100	 I am so glad my Aunt and her  partner are here , even if Lester isn't exactly the most honest or faithful person, it is  still nice to see Linda.
TrainSen	00100	 I love accents, I wish I had an english accent.
TrainSen	00100	 for some  reason I especially like the way after they say something they follow it up with  mate or love.
TrainSen	00100	 Another reason I want to move to London, I love the way they talk.
TrainSen	00100	 I  also love Orlando Bloom who also lives in England, he is gorgeous.
TrainSen	00100	 But  sometimes I wonder if he, in real life is stuck up or real down to earth.
TrainSen	00100	 That irritates  me when you see celebrities that think they can have anything they want, and the  way people gravel at their feet.
TrainSen	00100	 They are no different from the average joe other  than they can pretend to be someone they are not and get paid for it.
TrainSen	00100	 pretty sweet  deal actually, I wish someone would pay me to be someone else so I could live a  fairy tale.
TrainSen	00100	 Sometimes I wish life were like a movie, not like the Faculty though.
TrainSen	00100	 more like Kate and Leopold.
TrainSen	00100	 Mostly love stories, that would be amazing.
TrainSen	00100	 Though  at the same time it might be too predictable.
TrainSen	00100	 One can wish though right.
TrainSen	00100	 I wonder  what I am going to be when I grow up, I mean really grow up.
TrainSen	00100	 I really have no  likes or dislikes, which sometimes makes me wonder, if I have a personalitly, or if I  am just here.
TrainSen	00100	 How is it possible for people to exist anyways.
TrainSen	00100	 I don't know if I buy  the whole evolution thing or the Bible.
TrainSen	00100	 If the Bible is true then were did the  dinosaurs come from.
TrainSen	00100	 And if  vice versa then how did the Bible come about.
TrainSen	00100	 I still  believe there is a God because I think it is important to have something to believe  in.
TrainSen	00100	 But sometimes I think what if God wasn't real.
TrainSen	00100	 There would be many times I  would be lost in my life in that case.
TrainSen	00100	 For some reason.
TrainSen	00001	well I am sitting here in my bed just before 11 AM on a thursday morning writing out a  conscious stream of my thoughts.
TrainSen	00001	 my girlfriend is coming to see me this weekend and I'm  excited about that, as well as the fact that my best friend is going back home for the weekend  and leaving his apartemnt at my disposal.
TrainSen	00001	 an apartment is a much better place to stay with  your girlfriend than any god-forsaken dormatory, especially since my room mate will be here.
TrainSen	00001	 football game saturday agains UNT, and I love my football.
TrainSen	00001	 I've always loved college football  and now that I get to go and watch my team, one of the best in the nation, play is a great  experience for me, on that I will enjoy greatly for the next few years.
TrainSen	00001	 speaking of which, I'm  pretty hacked off that I was unaware that you had to purchase tickets to the OU game  seperately, and more than that, that there was no obvious information on the season ticket  website about this.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm getting back into the flow of school again, and most of my classes seem  like they will be rather easy, assuming that I read the material and pay attention in class, which I  might add is tough to do on a regular basis.
TrainSen	00001	 I've havent attended a single calculus study  session which greatly frees up my tuesdays and thursdays, having only one class in the late  afternoon.
TrainSen	00001	 I love not having to write with proper punctuation and capitalization.
TrainSen	00001	 the  experiment in class the other day was very interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 I personally though lie detectors were a  bunch of crap, but the psychological side of them is pretty interesting.
TrainSen	00001	 I wouldn't mind doing a  psychological study of poker players and how they interact while playing hold 'them, etc.
TrainSen	00001	 Some of  the calls they make about other peoples hands are simply amazing.
TrainSen	00001	 what makes someone fold  a good hand?  what makes a person be able to win on a bluff?  these are interesting events to  me.
TrainSen	00001	 but anyways, I wish I didn't have any homework this weekend, as a matter of fact I need to  finish reading chapter three in my psyc book, I'll attend to that after I finish writing this.
TrainSen	00001	 hmmmm, what else, oh yeah.
TrainSen	00001	 last night I played with four of my friends in a pick up game at  the gym.
TrainSen	00001	 the first game we won, the second game we won, and the third game we lost by one  shot to a team led by a steriod, testosterone-over pumped crazy kid who was a complete jerk.
TrainSen	00001	 it's interesting that everyone on my team was pissed off, except for me.
TrainSen	00001	 they are normally the  ones who tell me to chill out cause I get mad and stuff.
TrainSen	00001	 I sort of miss dallas and my girl, but I  know that we're both very committed and that she loves me a lot.
TrainSen	00001	 she's a great girl and I'd hate  to have to do all this without her, although I wish she was at TSU, that would make things  much, much easier.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm really hungry, I wish this timer would hurry up, I need to shave, wash  my face, brush my teeth, eat something, finish reading, do some homework, and study for a  quiz I have tomorrow in economics.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope that quiz won't be too hard.
TrainSen	00001	 I'll just have to  memorize the stuff in the book such as the expendeture approach to GDP, which is that  GDP=C+I+G+(I'M-EX).
TrainSen	00001	 wow, I'm really glad I can remember that and I havent even studied yet,  but the income approach is a little harder, even though I know I can get that easily if I just study  it for a little while.
TrainSen	00001	 will thanks for the time, my 20 are up.
TrainSen	00001	 bye.
TrainSen	00010	     I'm home.
TrainSen	00010	 wanted to go to bed but remembered that I had a psychology homework to complete by sometime during next week.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe this wouldn't take that long.
TrainSen	00010	 I can handle this.
TrainSen	00010	 Something is making a noise in the restroom.
TrainSen	00010	 Did I turn on the fan? I got to write more.
TrainSen	00010	 This is harder than I thought.
TrainSen	00010	 I'm not thinking anything.
TrainSen	00010	 Was I always like this when I didn't have anything to do? Should I go to bed after finishing this assignment or should I stay awake.
TrainSen	00010	 I think I had an appointment with someone.
TrainSen	00010	 Or maybe it was some kind of meeting, that was not mandatory to participate in.
TrainSen	00010	 Is there any assignments besides this.
TrainSen	00010	 My roommate took my digital camera yesterday, but it's right beside me, now.
TrainSen	00010	 Wonder what he did with it.
TrainSen	00010	 I'll ask him when he comes back.
TrainSen	00010	 My eyes hurt.
TrainSen	00010	 I should really do something about my glasses.
TrainSen	00010	 When should I go fix it.
TrainSen	00010	 ? Feel tired.
TrainSen	00010	 I should really go to bed.
TrainSen	00010	 Only 9 minutes passed.
TrainSen	00010	 Half way done.
TrainSen	00010	 Wonder if I can just stop here.
TrainSen	00010	 Maybe not.
TrainSen	00010	 Hm.
TrainSen	00010	 let's see.
TrainSen	00010	 What am I thinking? Wow my feet are covered with dirt.
TrainSen	00010	 Amazing I didn't notice that until now.
TrainSen	00010	 How did I get this on my legs? I want to wash it off but I'll wait until this assignment is over.
TrainSen	00010	 8 minutes to go.
TrainSen	00010	 What are my parents doing anyway? Hope they're doing fine.
TrainSen	00010	 When would they be able to receive the email I sent few minutes ago.
TrainSen	00010	 Anyways, I feel like I really had to finish something today but can't remember what it was.
TrainSen	00010	 Guess I'll figure it out after taking a nap.
TrainSen	00010	 Am I still not there.
TrainSen	00010	 Never knew how long a 20 minute could be.
TrainSen	00010	 Thirsty.
TrainSen	00010	 No water around.
TrainSen	00010	 Now I'm curious what the purpose of this assignment is and what kind of point professor is trying to make.
TrainSen	00010	 Time is almost up.
TrainSen	10000	     Stream of consiousnesssskdj.
TrainSen	10000	 How do you spell that? Fuck if I know.
TrainSen	10000	 I don't seem to know much today.
TrainSen	10000	 why the fuck am I so off.
TrainSen	10000	 I'm just writing this shit cause it sounds pitiful.
TrainSen	10000	 Or will hell the writing sounds like I'm writing for someone else to read.
TrainSen	10000	 No one is going to read this, nor does what I write matter.
TrainSen	10000	 So confess away.
TrainSen	10000	 Make it worthwhile.
TrainSen	10000	 What is this fucking heat I feel all the time, what the hell, I've heard the scientific explanations but they don't feel right.
TrainSen	10000	 Hot cold I don't know.
TrainSen	10000	 It prickles mwhen I should.
TrainSen	10000	 I got a damn ticket today.

TrainSen	10000	 I was doing so good but I knew it was coming it was inevitable I f I brag about what I have why shoul di have what I get its not the fucking point to tel everyone else that I have it better than them.
TrainSen	10000	 humanity is fuckecd can we save it which I knew I don't know anything all scienctific fac tis bullshit maybe some theory might hold over but that would be total luck.
TrainSen	10000	 string wtf.
TrainSen	10000	 microfribers connecting us all.
TrainSen	10000	 Howhippie that's ridiculous how do I float about life s  easily just things come when I need them to.

TrainSen	10000	 jese what the hell was that I would like know.
TrainSen	10000	 Dead space.
TrainSen	10000	 And I type what a prick.
TrainSen	10000	 the constant battle.
TrainSen	10000	 Why is there a batlle are normal people at peace I don't think so otherwise well religion .

TrainSen	10000	 Reviewing what I have writtin was odd, it was like reading a trippers rants while high.
TrainSen	10000	 My warmth.
TrainSen	10000	 Wow, I sound so out there.
TrainSen	10000	 I do feel that this is the way though, my path was a gift and I should appreciate it.
TrainSen	10000	 Most people don't get to have visions of their daughter, I don't rember the face anymore, I'm so lost.
TrainSen	10000	 This is so hard to do.
TrainSen	10000	 I hate it.
TrainSen	10000	 Why can't we just have our time.
TrainSen	10000	 Alone.
TrainSen	10000	 Away.
TrainSen	10000	 Just the two of us and then the little one.
TrainSen	10000	 I can't remeber her face but I can remeber that emotion.
TrainSen	10000	 what a physical change when I think of her.
TrainSen	10000	 I can feel the warmth surrounding my body.
TrainSen	10000	 The love taking everything over.
TrainSen	10000	 but then the back gives out and I kill my chakras.
TrainSen	10000	 Transliteration sucks.
TrainSen	10000	 20 min of writing my thoughts is intense.
TrainSen	10000	 the difference in punctuation is shocking, in the begging I used a lot of epsilons(mas o menos) and was excited, then I peak and nothing but chops of sentances, no punctiuations, calm down, have commas, and then periods.
TrainSen	10000	 awesome, I lost my network connection.
TrainSen	10000	 I wonder if that ruins this.
TrainSen	00100	It is Wednesday, December 8th and a lot has been going on this semester.
TrainSen	00100	 I am trying to finish the semester out as strong as possible but it has not gone the way it was expected to go.
TrainSen	00100	 although the overall grades that will be received is not that overall impressive, I know the work that was put into this semester was the most put into to school since high school.
TrainSen	00100	 the only class that was a disappoint meant so far was my psy class.
TrainSen	00100	 with two test left, there was still a chance to make an A or B in the class which was expected.
TrainSen	00100	 it turns out after bad test four results when everything felt as if the test went well, the goal of the class shifted from trying to get an A or B to get simply trying to get a C and pass.
TrainSen	00100	 granted that the most stress of the semester fell during the week of test three due to all the health issues and having like 10 different assignments and three test, it was still a disappointing outcome but focus can only be placed on what is left.
TrainSen	00100	 the last three exam are going to be pretty tough with a chance for me to make to A's and a B's if a perfect score is received on two of the finals and an A on the other.
TrainSen	00100	 My only focus has been on the two exams on Saturday but it does not feel like there is enough time in the day for every topic to be covered.
TrainSen	00100	 all that can be done is to prepare as much as possible and pray that everything turns out right.
TrainSen	00100	 doing well in school this semester would relieve the large amount of pressure that is a result of me not being concerned with school over family issues.
TrainSen	00100	 It seems as though just when I try to get on track a new unthinkable obstacle just shows up.
TrainSen	00100	 this semester the fact that I was taken advantage of and received and std as a result of doing something I did not want to do in the first place really makes me mad but I still have to be mad at myself for getting myself in that situation.
TrainSen	00100	 next semester hopefully no random distractions will pop up and my grades will be all a's which is very possible for me to achieve.
TrainSen	00100	 Making it through this semester is the number one thing in mind right now.
TrainSen	00100	 all that is left is to push through these exams and finish strong.
TrainSen	00100	 all I can do is my best the rest is out of my hands.
TrainSen	00100	 I have to do something to make it easier for my parents.
TrainSen	00001	Man this week has been hellish.
TrainSen	00001	 Anyways, now it's time for the 20 minute writing assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 I'm pretty exhausted at the moment, and have a lot of studying to do tonight.
TrainSen	00001	 My eyelids are pretty heavy, my hair damp.
TrainSen	00001	 I just got out of the shower because I was working out.
TrainSen	00001	 I think I have developed a pretty noticable case of ADD (attention deficate disorder) from various substances.
TrainSen	00001	 It's difficult for me to keep writing without my mind wandering.
TrainSen	00001	 My friend just walked in the room talking about some funny asian kids next door to us.
TrainSen	00001	 Now its going to be even harder to concentrate.
TrainSen	00001	 He just said the word tit.
TrainSen	00001	 It's such a funny word, I'm sure you would agree.
TrainSen	00001	 My mouth tastes like butt, I need to stop smoking cigarettes.
TrainSen	00001	 Crap, I just looked at the time and realized I didn't record what time I started at.
TrainSen	00001	 I hope this thing is timing it for me.
TrainSen	00001	 ""Simply type continuously, tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes.
TrainSen	00001	 "" My thoughts are scrambled.
TrainSen	00001	 So much to soak in, so much going on.
TrainSen	00001	 Individual words strike up new emotions about various subjects.
TrainSen	00001	 My friend said the word mom, I thought of my mom.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't want to go home and probably wouldn't except for the fact that my mom misses me so much.
TrainSen	00001	 I keep getting distracted by music that I'm playing, it's probably not best to be listening to it while working, but this is an informal assignment (if I remember correctly) so hopefully I'll be fine.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't wait for tomorrow to be over and the weekend to begin.
TrainSen	00001	 The band I'm listening to is called The Roots, they'll be playing next weekend at ACL.
TrainSen	00001	 I'd really like to see them there, they are a really good and well known hip-hop group.
TrainSen	00001	 Tix are 80 bucks so its doubtful ill be going all 3 days, maybe I'll just get a one day pass.
TrainSen	00001	 I could also meet a lot of people at the ACL fest (hopefully).
TrainSen	00001	 I feel kind of lonely at the moment, I thought I would have made a lot more knew friends here at the university by now.
TrainSen	00001	 It seems to me that most people are still hanging out with their friends and clicks from high school, kind of lame in my opinion.
TrainSen	00001	 I hang out with my roommate and another friend from high school, most of the time the latter.
TrainSen	00001	 We go out and attempt to seek out other people like us, whom we find unique or ""cool.
TrainSen	00001	 "" One major complaint I have about the people here is that it seems like everyone is still trying to prove themselves.
TrainSen	00001	 Just like high school, except more facial hair.
TrainSen	00001	 I might just be depressed and seeing everything in a negative light, but at the moment it all seems logical to me.
TrainSen	00001	 My friend just came back in the room.
TrainSen	00001	 He's cool.
TrainSen	00001	 We're going to go study chemistry as soon as I'm done with this assignment.
TrainSen	00001	 Man I need to stop chatting on the internet, my typing is really horrible.
TrainSen	00001	 I keep forgetting to capitalize letters, and I keep spelling things incorectly.
TrainSen	00001	 Like I was saying, it's a pitty that everyone here seems so fake.
TrainSen	00001	 Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people that seem really interesting, but at the same mind it sickens me how everyone conforms to certain styles and clicks.
TrainSen	00001	 god damn, grow up people.
TrainSen	00001	 Everyone's trying so hard to get laid.
TrainSen	00001	 Please don't grade me down.
TrainSen	00001	 I can't help but writing about this crap, it consumes me.
TrainSen	00001	 Writing this actually hasn't been hard at all.
TrainSen	00001	 Right now I'm feeling a little more relaxed and lighthearted than I was before writing.
TrainSen	00001	 it might be a good idea to start writing regularly.
TrainSen	00001	 It could be good for me, and I think it's cool when people do things like that.
TrainSen	00001	 I love writing, but not necessarily structured writing.
TrainSen	00001	 I wonder how long it's been.
TrainSen	00001	 My whole body is tired, man I'm lonely.
TrainSen	00001	 I need a girlfriend! Party's are NOT a good way to meet girls here, stupid sluts just looking for a good time.
TrainSen	00001	 It seems like there are less people here like me than I thought there would be.
TrainSen	00001	 I was expecting a more mature student body.
TrainSen	00001	 Don't get me wrong, I like partying, I love getting drunk, I love having fun.
TrainSen	00001	 I don't know where I'm going with this.
TrainSen	00001	 It just seems people here are kind of stuck up on themselves, and not as intelligent and interesting as I thought they would be.
TrainSen	00001	 Oh well, we all can dream.
TrainSen	01000	I have just gotten off the phone with brady.
TrainSen	01000	 I'm trying to decide what exacly we will do  this weekend.
TrainSen	01000	 he wants to go to a hotel, but I know I have to babysit and I'm not sure exactly  how I will tell my dad to pick us up from here.
TrainSen	01000	 My birthday is this weekend, and it doesn't really  even feel like it.
TrainSen	01000	 I don't really mind, but I have a feeling Brady probably won't do much for it.
TrainSen	01000	 I  almost feel like I'm always doing something for him.
TrainSen	01000	 I should, I really care about him.
TrainSen	01000	 He says  he will pay for the hotel, but I don't really want that for my birthday.
TrainSen	01000	 I'ts just not htat important  to me.
TrainSen	01000	 I feel guilty today for lying to my dad about gettin gout of the TIP program.
TrainSen	01000	 I know that  sometimes I have to lie about things like that in order for them to understand.
TrainSen	01000	 I haven't heard  from my mom so I'm not sure if she's mad at me or not.
TrainSen	01000	 She probably doesn't care, but when  she does find out she will freak.
TrainSen	01000	 I wish Brady would pay more attention.
TrainSen	01000	 He tries so hard, but it  doesn't s
